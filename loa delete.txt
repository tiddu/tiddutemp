Quality happiness instead of just happiness
This gives class
You choose instant gratification because it is certain whereas the result in delayed gratification is uncertain , and you get programmed like this bcoz of earlier life events.
When you are generally happy , addictions don't grip you that much.
Create a doc - good things that will certainly come which are gooder than these

Convert absurd to meaningful
It's very easy to be happy these days , main thing is meaning
Context
Create meaningful things
Quality happiness , not ordinary
Life is but meaningful desires
Desires you choose
Suppose desire of nehal
Why it doesn't look meaningful , what what absurdities.
To not have a gf at this age is absurd , to not falling of her in my love after this much interest is absurd , to drop her at this point is absurd , to drop her bcoz other guys and jealousy is absurd , to not Chase such beauty is absurd , to complex of your height is absurd ,..

Create potential or fun once you get a background
And when you get it , enjoy tapping the potential. Realise that you are tapping the potential
If a single.. doesn't make sense , combine it with other till it make sense or motivational. Like, meds..
Negatively too
Tasks which have big impact

How quickly will it give results , not for how long
How quick it will give long time results
goal of the life is to find more and more ways to make your life more nostalgic n memorable
Such that good memories chase you same way bad memories do
Go in future for it may have those events and things that finally make your life/past nostalgic and memorable if it's not already
Make your past nostalgic from history
Right now, it maybe is like a plain boring monotonous history book
But with right events n things, it may turn into nostalgic n memorable
Life is meant to be an awesome scrapbook
A bouquet of awesome memories
Strive for a future which enables you to create such past
A sweet memorable past
Don't try to make a past nostalgic or forcefully try to remember or Memorise good memories bcoz if they are really really good n memorable, you don't have to Memorise them.. They will come in your mind just like bad regrets and guilts do at 3am
You know.. Atleast you can be sad in your own way, who knows, if you get married in that family which you said felt greedy, you can't even be sad in your own way
Like the mother in law expecting you to make tea even if you are not in mood
Things like that
We get sad when big things don't happen in life on time but life will always be sad when you live as if you just have this life
This happens to everyone
Even if those who are in successful positions, they fear that they are not in right position at life
The potential paradox
Sadness is imminent if one live life as if it's just one life
Bcoz only one mistake can ruin a life
Suppose, everything going good, but an accident n blinded for whole life, but if that same person start living as if he is not limited to just one life
Life will get easy
Yes
Even if the current one is not going that good, don't worry, bcoz you are not limited to this life only
Even if you are married to your desired place, and with all good things, you would be sad, thinking that what is this beautiful life ends
Michael Jackson was afraid of death
He wanted to live 150 years
Appointed 16 doctors to increase his life
That which one should I go for
Why can’t I make decision
There are multiple approaches to this
- you choose both.. Best of both worlds
- or write pros n cons of both n decide
- take the mainstream popular way
- check your instinct
- Try both and stay with one you love most after trying

Wisdom abt happiness
Sunday, February 12, 2017
6:49 PM
You don't need to be happy (in future etc) bcoz You always are happy in p.m
But
Why you forget or cannot see/notice you are happy in pm -
No reason detected
You cannot locate it in mind
This is Loa too maybe
Happiness from sex and from sports is same. So , no need to collect resources to fulfill resources exhaustive desires but simple. Only have money required to just ward off untolerables in life , not magicals bcoz life is already magical. And no need to have variety in desires.
an epiphany
15-Feb-18
20:05
You love desires but make doing tasks easy bcoz
Its not that desires don't motivate you , they motivate you but only very less. You wouldn't know how a desire feels before the desire.
Its not that failures and impossible desires demotivate you but only for some little time
Its the bad tasks management that demotivates you at great extent
Categorize and do tasks by
stand , sitting etc

Options if you don't find life worth living for - 
Kill yourself
Or
Live and Stress brainstorm yourself for finding techniques
Or
Live and Keep doing habits, wait for desires and passions
.. So that one day when you get hit by that passionate desires and reasons to live by.. You will by then have the body and resources to enjoy the shit out of it
It's hard to be inspired all time.. Inspired for something.. Sometimes you just don't have a reason to live.. Thats when you close your mind and keep doing karma (good habits) without thinking of phal and simply passively wait for inspirations to come to live for.. And when they come.. You are prepared for them to enjoy to fully enjoy them.
Even if you get inspiration, you would be doing the same habits that you can do without inspiration too. Bcoz same time.
What else option
Be happy that there will by so many opportunities and times for  inspirations
Do what you would be doing if/when you be inspired
Be as if you are inspired
As if you found the meaning
Do things as if you are inspired, motivated. And as if found the reason to do them
Different - Smartness

Smart
Whatever you do , do smartly
Smart and clever
Smart survival
No new desires , just do routine things smartly ,or whatever comes to you.
There is no limit to smartness

Easy
-----------
Difficult, that which you do not want to manifest, see it as difficult
-----------
so, you just need to feel it is easy, through any tech . only those desires aren't fulfilled which you thought are difficult. You only think about those desires which you see as difficult bcoz you don't need to think in case of easy ones. Easy ones get difficult once you try to manifest them bcoz the trying vibrates that they aren't easy. Easy ones don't even registers as desires bcoz they fulfill by themselves. 
fear of difficulty is the main problem, seeing it as easy or thinking about it make it probable or bring it to your life even if you aren't interested in it or it is not in your life , bcoz thinking about it vibrates that it is easy to happen
That's why loa works when you stop caring, bcoz it vibrates that you don't think it as difficult or no need to effort, and easy
Ways :
Searchingly interested/wait , and when you believe it is not difficult to manifest/happen
So, Visualise it solving it, it getting solved by it, and sim see in that visualisation..
How easily it is solved in visualisation, how easily.. Visualisation, abundance of solution, etc
Also visualise your doubts or doubting nature too getting solved.. And by..
Also problem of visualizing and clearly and..
How easily it could solve it
And see how easily the satisfaction in that case can/could happen, if it happen
How easily it could be in your life/pm/area/here
Feelulise how easily it could solve it and how easily it and it's bonuses /sideeffects/repercussions/effects/satisfaction/doubts could be incorporate/be-managed/believed/adjusted/manifested into/among/in-the-middle-of your daily/these-days/current-day-to-day-life/outside-reality. How it is not difficult or not that difficult
How easily it can be digested/accepted/believed
How easily loa can manifest it
You attract what you are
Like ld
Difficult to easy
It is not solid
Prepare yourself for reactions for pure magical manifestations which are deliberate
Believable/unbelievable/not-unbelievable/..
It solve it, and is it impossible? Is it impossible in next 24 hours or at that place or like that 
Vibrations - easy or difficult 
Visualise yourself getting it easily. Use ways/similies
Visualise how will you desire it if you feel it is not difficult to happen , and interesting, idea
It solve it 
Combination of - it, me, pm, here, happiness 
Contradictory 
Complete experience 
Visualise yourself remembering/holding /having the/that experience 
Memory 
Consciousness 
Visualise/want  it/the-experience/the-event happening to you/your-consciousness , and the way it happening to you.. 
Visualise it happening to you like an experience
Visualise it as a very casual part of your life or it happening very casually in your life 
Be as if it is already in your life, you have it, present, use creative ways - 
As if in almira
Parallel reality, as if you are mistakenly in similar parallel reality than your destined original reality. 
When wakeup from dream 
Just need to realize 
Visualise how I will see it's uniqueness at that time 
Experience the experience 
It solve it 
Think about it, but not as of something not present or of future or yet to.., but as of something of present, already etc. Iykwim. 
Think about it like you think about your shirts which you have 
Think about it whatever you want to think about it but as if you are thinking about something which you have/heard/seen/enjoyed/used/.. Etc, not which you haven't heard/seen/enjoyed 
How do you think about something which you.. 
Think about it similarly when you think about some completed/accomplished/finished desire, not uncompleted. Note - not finished manifestation but satisfaction/quench/thirst
Visualise it solve it, and see that it solved (already/did) it (in visualisation/visualized world/reality) (in the world of visualization) 
You get it when you are searchingly interested in it, and you are Searchingly interested in it when you see it as solution of something, and as already in your life or what you are. 
Ex - bareli
It solve it
Visualise it(1) solving/setting it(2) in future
Future/tomorrow/near-future
It(1)/loa/magic-box/this-loa-activity-right-now/..
Like prayer
Bcoz..
Happening in future
This incites Searchingly interested
Visualise it solved in future
Visualise it as the future in that case
It becoming present/past/memory
Visualise this loa activity/effort making it the future in that case
Visualise it as the future and visualise that Future happening somewhere or is present., visualise it happening as a possibility/parallel-reality somewhere. Like that cetrizine thing.
Visualise how it would feel
-if that Future is going to happen any moment now
-to be Curious in above
-to be curious in How probable/impossible it can get in that situation 
Excited 
Be as if this is very probable (to happen) these nows or in that situation, than other moments 
Probable in mobile than radio 
Hunting probability chain 
Maybe Visualise it transforming from present to that
Creations/manifestations journal is things you liked And don't see as difficult, and the rest of the things which you like and sees as not easy are called as desires.

Sections sorted by related related points
Motivation comes when you know way ex social..
Structure of docs n sections previously
Good things that will start
Bad things that will stop soon
Excuse – it is boring or difficult or tiring
Excuse – not logical ,no luck ,universe is against , all efforts are futile ,
Bcoz we are sad not bcoz we are sad but bcoz the world is sad
But when you know that the world is enjoying, you will feel an unparalleled happiness
Bcoz deep down, you care for the world
It's just we are busy in things in life, that we don't get time to give back to people
These groups are my way to give back to people, to share, my thoughts that benefited me
Why you judge the judging
Don't see judging as bad, and you'll immediately neutralize the judging
The same way, you destroy an enemy, when you choose to see them as not even worthy of being your enemy
Create problems in your life to hold yourself from ego.. Iykwim
*sometimes we unknowingly create problems in our life to make us modest and gentle and down to earth*
[04/11, 6:36 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Bcoz deep down we know that ego will limit us for we will see ourselves as perfect and that we don't need improvements
[04/11, 6:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You are not perfect as you are
[04/11, 6:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): But you are also not imperfect as you are
[04/11, 6:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You are ok but can be better
[04/11, 6:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Live with this attitude
one bad apple can make all apples rot. similarly , one positive person can make the rest positive. y we see that we will become negative by the negative people , y our positivity is so fickle , y can't our positivity be so strong that it destroy the heck of their negativity. make yourself the person you want to see your family as and soon your thoughts will touch them. soon , your wisdom and openmindedness and great ideas will appeal to them.
i have three docs in my diary.. project dad , project mom , project sis.. in each doc , i write any idea or point i get about them , their favorite things , their hate , their passions , how they think , issues , quirks etc
and everyday i do one thing for my family like a chore. even if it is letting mom know that i have seen the video she sent me on whatsapp even if i didn't. i make sure that she actually beleive that , and if the video is good , i finsh the video rather than dropping it.
overall , family needs active participation
get filled with so many desires , that your love for life , will catch them like a contagious laughter
My life is all time favorite
We learn most and the best from our own lives
Bcoz whatever we learn from it is very relatable, useful and practical
Imagine people doing these together -
Dance
Meditation
Dreaming
..
Benefits of own -
House - full privacy, bring any girl, place anything anywhere, decorate as your wish, music, introvert acc to you, porn with audio, parties, bring friends, talk freely, without clothes, fully mad, Exercise naked ,
Money -
Identity -
Note - not new desires, but you are not efforting bcoz you are comfy with what you have, although, there are few things wrong with what you have
A future where
Instead of imagining your desire in future, imagine the time before the desire, the excitement and thrill before the desire, the anticipation etc
Visualise a future with strong potential of nostalgia
Where in night, you have hundreds of things to say you liked in the day
*it's hard to visualise good things in future bcoz most often we unknowingly and automatically project our current depression and sadness into an otherwise possibly feel good future*
The mood in present distort the mood in future
Things or facts I didn't knew before.. That i can like them so much.. -

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d0jjc2/the_2010s_decade_will_be_over_in_4_months_what_do/
Read this thread
You'll find many things that you get to see in this decade which you couldn't have imagine before the decade
Same way, you'll see many cool things in the next decade
Future is exciting
Stages
Struggling to fulfill desires without powers
Like trying to read an English book without knowing the language of English
Powers necessary to fulfill and enjoy desires, and, also only after the powers, you'll get new ideas for desires
People whose boring lives make me feel that everyone lives like that -
Dad - frugal jerk
Jf - miserable cheap
..
Actually That is good, that is good too, that is also good too.. Everything is fine
It is good doesn't mean that is bad or have to be bad
Not that it is working good so that will not work good or be bad
Be as if that past event doesn't mean that but will mean that in future
instead of reading books written by authors who themselves aren't rich, try to find and read books written by rich people even if the book is not about money bcoz you'll indirectly learn about their thinking process from the books they wrote
Or if couldn't find books by then, find books loved by them
Fuck books on how to get rich written by poor authors
Best is to read "mickey mouse and club" even if written by billionaire
Coz you want to tap into how a billionaire think
 And a book is the best representation of how author thinks

------------------------
Dt main
All your desires r tasks , all your tasks are tasks
Goal is to have interest to fulfill them
When u hv interest , they fulfill with help of universe which is loa
Loa is n have the meaning of life too. So,its good that meaning docs r in loa section
If u do tasks in these ways , u get interest in tasks n interest will make universe work for tasks
U Do tasks almost whole life , so doing tasks with .. Is like living life with …
Health , money etc is not the target but something with which u do tasks with so as to do tasks interestingly n with interest
To do tasks interestingly , do tasks ..ly ,..ly , ..   N when u do it , this is meaning of life n loa happens.
All inclusive tech
Tasks management
Prioritywise
Visualisation is. A vague n generic term
Funningly
Ex, enjoying car with these - money , health , differently , creatively , ..
Tasks are mostly abt things , so , how to enjoy things bcoz if u know , u would be interested in that thing
What to do if life feels stuck , how to feel it is happening/moving , how to get results -
meta
*goal of the life is to feel that you are not stuck in life*
That's it
Bcoz stucking somewhere is a death in itself
It doesn't mean to try to change your outer world
If you are growing mentally, you are not stuck in life
We want to feel that we are not stuck in life bcoz it shows within ourselves that we are evolving, that we are the leading edge of the existence.
If you are creative and full of ideas, you are growing
And you are not stuck
Though, I'll share some techs that will actually make you feel that you are moving in life
Also some techs that will make you feel like you moving
One is multitasking
When you multitask, you'll get multiple results from here and there and that'll make you feel as if you are progressing and going forward
Bcoz movement is evolution
Only a life that is moving makes you motivate to make it more moving. Stalled one makes you more stalled. Kinda momentum theory
I want a future where I highly feel or amap feel that my life is moving/happening. And all the past when it wasn't moving is being compensated
What if life feels too much moving
What about ego of life moving..
Highly effective solutions
It is not stuck bcoz
See the old and new Aditya doc
It is changing in background
Superficially it will always be same, but interesting details will come
It is changing by months and not days
It seems everything as same but one day, feels like everything have changed
Life is happening fast inside, happening outside or not doesn't matter. Bcoz relative to inside, outside life is nothing.
life is absolutely bland by nature.. Just use interesting techniques to live by
There is no meaning in life
Just create interesting techniques to live by
Interesting ideas behind techniques
But separate the ones which help in tasks
Even if the results are intresting but technique is boring, you most probably can't go long with that technique
There is no technique in life to live by.. Life is utterly meaningless but.. You want to live by some interesting techniques.. N not boring.. You want the meaning in life to be intresting. So, divide zorba techs by intresting or not n how much
Interesting techniques is the dopamine.. N not via them.. Doing intresting techs is fun.. Not..
Interesting ways to live life
Life is interesting from mind
always remember that life is not interesting from outside but inside. From interesting thoughts and ideas
good that these good things didn't happen -
I'm glad these good things didn't happen - shubhangi, bindu,..
Poverty we've seen - fridge, car, bath water,
Suffered through..
Survived through - efforts,
I'm better than a jobless bcoz - loa, I'm working on other things, I'm enjoying life, I'm taking along all things, I have time, I don't have problems like kids etc
it's easy to be grateful for the things that kept/keeping/will-keep you safe
Be grateful for the things that kept/keeping/will-keep you safe
To more enjoy this tech, deliberately create situations, go into situations
Sanity, logic
The bed - it is keeping you safe from the ground and all the germs and critters.. Since long, now and in future
The house -.. From so many risks and threats..
food -.. from malnutrition, diseases, weakness..
Etc
life is a name of deliberately going into risks to enjoy your safeties
We risk paraglide bcoz we love the safety of the wires and cables with which we are secured
We risk watching horror movies bcoz we love the safety that it is just a movie
Safety is cozy, safety is survival
Survival
It will feel unstuck when
A life which will keep you entertaining , A life which will right when you get bored, presents you with awesome ways/options of fun (increasingly)..
Goal is to make those ways interesting and increase in quality and quantity, and as quickly as possible 
It is not difficult to unstuck 
A single positive or negative major event can change your life
Yours is not changing but others is, what if, your life gets in touch with them and you caught their speed
It will have to change with time bcoz of global changes and futorology
Enjoy the stuck life
A life where you daily work for collecting and collect things which can be use and enjoyed daily so that with time, you'll have plethora of such cool and interesting things which you can use and enjoy daily.
[06/11, 12:04 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Live for such a life
[06/11, 12:13 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): There are two type of things or desires for which you effort one.. One, which you can enjoy/use daily (like bed, your vehicle, your house etc) and things which you use rarely or very occasionally (like that piano sitting in your basement). So, effort for things which you can use/enjoy daily. Collect such things. And with time, your life will only get better and better for you have things that are making your life easier /fun and useful day by day.
A life changing too much is also scary
Benefits of doing same things daily - perfection, maintain results, habit, internalizing, flow,
Imagine yourself really liking it
Imagine it exceeding your expectations
Immerse
Know that
You worked good on those powers, don't leave on 99%
Just solve the few selected big obstacles
Freedom is able to solve your problems freely.. Without any obstacle
A time when you can easily solve your problems
Daily annoyances n intolerables
Old problems I m tired of solving and not interesting anymore -
House quarrels
Girls
Joblessness
Goobi marriage
Jf
Life big tasks in which we are lagging behind - car, job, marriage, relatives, house, kid,
--------
Just see that for what whatever you efforted for and is efforting this month is being cashed this month or not
Similar unknown positive experiences
Imagine a day there full of positive surprises
Maybe - of same magnitude
Like.. In meditation..
don't imagine all about your desire bcoz it will kill the surprise element
Isn't imagination is the basis of loa?
Yes but if you imagined all the possibilities in the desire, what else will be left to explore?
Imagination is a tool to make you interested enough in the desire to want and manifest and to do efforts for it, but not that much that you feels like you enjoyed it all just in your imagination bcoz after that your interest in the desire will only go downhill
Just my 2 cents
Omg this is why manifestation doesnt work..hahaha
Ok only imagine one possibility
Yes.. Lots of visualising is dangerous for the desire for you'll lost the fun factor
I think mine is turn into addiction ??
And yes, not fun anymore haha
You may have imagined all the scenarios
All the fun possibilities
Sometimes and most of the times a desire remains strong when left with "What if" factor
Suppose, take lambhorghini for example, not that I want it, but I just use it in all my examples, here and on reddit,
Suppose you take lambhorghini for imagination, you imagine one fun scene with lambhorghini.. Imagine 2-3 but don't imagine all.. Stop the imagination at that.. At the *possibility that there is more such similar scenes you can enjoy with Lamborghini*.. This thought is very motivating.. That just like those 2 scenarios, you can have other multiple fun scenarios with Lamborghini when you'll have it, but you decide not to think about them now, for you'll lose all the fun and surprisingness
Take anything in your house, you can see, that you can easily have multiple fun scenarios with each item
Take Tea, you can enjoy it in multiple ways,.. Like with a friend, or, extra strong, or, using different Tea leaves, or mixing it with coffee, or drinking it while watching movie, etc etc.. So many fun scenarios.. But if you've imagined all.. Then you may not probably want to buy it bcoz you already imagined everything there is to imagine and that will make you see Tea as meh even if there are more fun scenarios you may not know
Don't stop imagination altogether
Imagine but only 1-2 fun scenarios and from those, know that there are more other such fun scenarios that you'll get to know after you fulfill the desire
Use the controlled balanced imagination as a Toffee to bait yourself to your desire by the power of subconscious which will make you think of the desire by the force of "What if"
Only way to keep a desire fresh and worthy enough to chase, effort and use loa for
We feel future as meaningless bcoz we think we imagined it all for the future
This is ignorance imo
That's why.. If you listen to your most favorite song too many times, you found that you are not liking it anymore
That's why, you don't want to watch a movie second or multiple times which you already enjoyed in first time in detail
And here we are taught by loa gurus to imagine the Fuck out of desires
No wonder the desire gets boring after a while and life feels meaningless
Imagine yourself using it to be excited of future
Imagine yourself getting hopes/desires/ideas from it
How it would raise my hopes
Excel.. List of how how many possible similars to that
Similars to that I didn't knew before (of things I have or had) 
Power of suggestibility
And other similar fun
Find techs like this

With which the whole day is coloured with
Live by days
Scheduled lifestyles like office etc ruined this awesome way of living
Days are boring if all days are just mixed.. N not distinct and distinguishable
This ways days get memorable and savable..savoury
What if main event is small - color the whole day with it, extend it, see preparations for it As part of it, give everything else the context of it
What about balance, what about exhaustion, what about chores and regular tasks, what about job n office time,
Highlight of the day with which the whole day is coloured
Maybe in excel, also write the percentage of how much colored
Also write the past days, but how to remember them.. You may not remember the dates though
Day dedicated to..
We remember the past events as days only.. Like.. The day when that happened..
Maybe - half or full
The day is gonna be colored by something for sure, so, why not you took control of what it should be coloured with. Otherwise, mostly it would be - laziness, sleeping, etc
The day when I found a way to individually export onenote docs
Add some change to every day, or do things differently
The way you handle it can be changed. Alter egos.

*life should be live such way that you fall in love with yourself more and more with time*
One way to motivation is knowing that.. Even if you will be lazy and procrastinate, You still will be going to effort.. If not for five hours, you will or have to one hour. But just think, that if you do only efforts for one hour a day and if you do for 5 hours a day, and both smartly, which will help you have a better life more
[04/11, 1:34 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): 12 hours a day efforts for your betterment is 12 times the efforts you do if you do efforts for one hour daily for your betterment
[04/11, 1:34 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You'll become 12 times better
[04/11, 1:34 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Your life 12 times better
[04/11, 1:35 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): So, why content with efforting less for a good life
[04/11, 1:40 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): It's hard to motivate yourself when you compare or relate it with laziness , motivation is relative, compare the results from five hour efforts daily with same kind of efforts but for one hour
[04/11, 1:40 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You'll get your answer
The results will get 12 times more, 12 times faster of one,
Your bike will be 12 times better
Your bed will be 12 times better
If you do 12 hours efforts for your lambhorghini instead of just 1 hr effort for it daily, you'll get a Lamborghini 12 times better than if you just do 1 hr efforts daily
If you do efforts daily for one hour vs efforts daily for 5 hours, both in smart way, which will give you more better life? 
2 kinds of laziness, one is where you don't get any results, another is where you comfortably enjoy results of your efforts. Which kind of laziness you want is on you.
[04/11, 11:46 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): The one before the winning or the one after the winning
[04/11, 11:46 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): The one which is full of regrets
[04/11, 11:47 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Or the one which is full of fuck yeah moments
Visualise yourself able to enjoy things more
Keep on living for who know about future.. Future is not what you have imagined.. Future is beyond your imaginations..
And
Evolution is always progressive
The world, universe.. Etc is evolving from good to gooder
Don't beleive what they show you in movies
Future is always better than the past
Evolution is a great designer
And the designs are improving
Rapidly
Quickly
Compoundingly
Exponentially
Those who live in past only remember the few good moments and see whole past in that rosy picture
Live bcoz future is evolving, bcoz the world is growing exponentially
Don't try to imagine a future without boredom bcoz first it is not possible and second boredom is necessary for creativity. Imagine a future where you are comfortable with your boredom.. With being bored... Where you are not bored of your boredom for you know you have many options to enjoy anyone
Anytime*
*you don't hate boredom.. You hate excess of boredom*
When you get ready to even embrace boredom, you'll find that nothing can bore you
And future will always be interesting for you are ready to embrace moments of boredom
For you know that you'll not get bore of boredom
For you know that you'll have multiple choices to quickly end the boredom
*Visualise interesting ways you are bored*
*One can't run away from boredom.. For it will chase you.. But chase great boredoms.. The path to boredom is often interesting.. Chase interesting boredoms*
Ex, after a great adventurous tour, you may feel boredom but you get that boredom after an interesting experience.. So, that boredom is intresting in a way. Chase such intresting boredoms
If you see future full of adventures, you may get meh bcoz you know you can't run away from boredoms but if you visualise even boredoms in a beautifully adjoined way, as not something isolated but something that have some great adventure associated with it.. You now don't hate boredoms and you placed boredom in a smart way
*you'll get bored after getting that lambhorghini*
*you'll get bored after getting that yacht*
*you'll get bored after traveling all the world*
But
The journey to these boredoms isn't boring
Is it?
*chase boredoms with intresting journeys*
*chase great boredoms*
For boredom will always be the true end result
Chase great boredoms
Chase intresting boredoms
Comfortable with being bored
Not bored of boredom
A future where you can easily embrace boredom
Imagine yourself able to easily embrace boredom for you know..
Daily do something for present and future both
Create an excel log of how how much both
Two columns
High medium low
This will make sure of balance
Thinking about meaning in life is also thinking about future
Only this is enough
instead of trying to be grateful for past or present,  try to be grateful for the future
For whatever is coming
Be grateful for that
For universe have nothing but greater goodness for you
And you may find that you now don't have complaints with the future
These make as if life is not stuck - New techs , events , efforts , results , ..
Do efforts
Results by executing ideas from which doc will make life feel more moving
Synchronicities makes life feel moving
Stuck powers
Make life move - do those tasks which brings long and big changes wrt time and effort invested.
In the tasks doc, isolate or create a group for tasks which will make life feel or actually moving
Which area of life seriously needs attention or repair bcoz one deflated tyre makes the whole car go halted/stopped
List of Stuck tasks -
OneNote double clicker selector
Project Bookmarks
Tasker issue
Halted bcoz lack of ideas or solutions , not resources
------------------------
Present
1] [particular efforts] Particularly good future [a future that is good in particular ways][particular success]
2] [general efforts] [general good future] Do efforts GENERALLY bcoz [benefits of doing efforts without anything particular target of future in mind] [general success]-
But of what - of your current tasks, multi tasks, multiple areas, daily tasks, whatever tasks are in your hands etc
Zorba -
Tasking doc is about how to efficiently do the efforts
Link efforts to.. 
Y
Bcoz
Very good reasons
You can't judge how much happy the future can make you
Humans are shortsighted
Future is unknown
Regret of not efforting for it earlier
Be as if everyone else also have dt so that you don't feel ego and only feel competition in dt
do you not want to complete things which are near results bcoz you don't know so many things are near results
This is boring doesn't mean that is boring too
This is boring doesn't mean that will be boring too 
Good

[28/02, 11:45 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): The sperm that didn't won won other competitions in other wombs. If not from one womb, then from another. No one lose. Everyone wins, either through this or that
[28/02, 12:05 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Not the physical sperm but the soul in the sperm. If failed in one womb, that soul will manifest itself in another womb as new sperm. Just my opinion.
[28/02, 12:06 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Sperm may go waste but not the soul in it
What if this life is not the main life but -
Trial
Just a start
Emulation
Just another Dream
..
Things I'll regret even if late success -
No kid
Kid at late
Late success
So many time and opportunity lost
..
You are sad bcoz -
You enjoyed a lot yesterday and compared to yesterday, today's boring
You expected a lot recently
..
Retirement plan (who will take care of me in future till comfy death) -
My kids and grandkids
Old age home
Volunteers
My followers
Schemes like insurance policies
Friends and relatives
My lawyer and family doctor
Google detailed retirement plan
..
What made life serious -
Religions
Society
..
Imagine wholesome situations -
Like evening tea with Vaibhav, - random good talk with strangers, tea vaala happy mood, all over leaving a perfect impression of perfectness on them
Imagine yourself making their these perfect - day,..
Imagine being able to successfully/beautifully/cleverly/improvingly hide/coverup your imperfections in front of them
Long term living -
That 3 days flow/streak thingie
Days coloured/flavoured with something particular happiness like particular gf etc
Big targets/projects
Places
Few days efforts and then batch results
Note - why - bcoz single single days are too many and no congruence. Congruency is life
You take this mental state you are currently in as taken for granted. Bcoz these things can easily have ruined it -
States - rechecking, mind clearance,
Things - pmo, tensions,
Try to imagine
Live by hour
15-Mar-20
2:10
No need to keep old log
Only current day
I won this hour, this hour, this hour
Productive
I think this is what is being in Present
You are sad bcoz of seeing the previous hours of the day as not productive and like a vicious cycle, it make you lazy
It will ensure dopamine boosts every hour
This will make you want to maintain or start legacy
You'll feel motivated to win every hour
This tech doesn't measure the content of hour but that the overall hour is win or not. This prevents variables and relatively fuckups
================
How it will prevent you from getting depressed or unwilling to do tasks like 1100 va inverter will stop me from getting unwilling to not do pceing or other tasks and will motivate me dopamine style many times to do things.., how good pajama will make me want to readily go to park. In fight against laziness and procrastination. This is meta taskish. To readily start things
Do those things which will help me in doing tasks
In outside tasks, inside tasks, pc tasks
Associate it with..
Goal of life is to do those efforts which will create an environment that will further help me in doing the efforts. Like a cycle
Which will help in flow of tasks..  Or that which will otherwise negatively affect the flow of tasks
Smooth flow of doing tasks
What if we live inverted and nighttime is the true Daytime
What if we live inverted. What if true life exist in dreams while we sleep. The pure sensory beauty. Everything is so magical in dreams whereas it may not true mostly in Daytime. What if we have days just to facilitate a good sleep. What if we are night creatures who are meant to dream and Daytime is just fillers. 
What if it's hard to motivate ourselves to live bcoz the Daytime is mostly boring by default and it's the dream time that is actually what makes lives magical and meaningful. To connect with those magical worlds.
Just an opinion.
Patience for Long term vs alternatives -
Porn vs real girl
..
Set in tasker a reminder - that if you get depressed or sad, know that even if life keep on sucking, there is atleast one tech in your dt n zorba doc that have the potential to make you genuinely happy and excited, and how to cope and manage the sadness depression and boredom
You may not know few or one atm but it doesn't mean that there isn't one which..

-------------------other
Just enjoy those moments even if small of richness
When drinking tea, see how many uncountable sips you can take, isn't this richness in a way
The abundance of sips
When sitting in sun, feel the abundance of warmth
The richness
Poverty is not just homelessness.
- If you are a housewife and you beg your rich husband to give you money, you are poor.
- if you are an employee and you have to do overtime, or flattery, and given salary like mercy, you are poor
- if you are someone driving a luxury car but you are under loans, you are poor
- if you have money, but no time to spend it, you are poor
- it is measured by the amount of desires you can't fulfill
The more difficult desires you have, the more poor you are
Heck even bill gates is poor in terms of privacy,  immortality,
He regrets not buying android on time
He regrets not giving windows phone enough attention
He regrets not purchasing Apple company
So, all in all, it is a state of mind. You feeling rich of poor is what matters
Rich or poor*
If you in jail, and you love that extra Tea given to you, you may feel rich. And if you are in some luxury hotel and you get served 5000€ exquisite dish with pea size, you may feel duped and poor.

[17/12, 12:19 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Imagine yourself feeling good about your life.
[17/12, 12:19 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Like everything is ordered and balanced and working
[17/12, 2:38 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): *spend every day as if you've given another day to live*
[17/12, 2:39 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): If you have some reminder app, set the above as a reminder to popup every morning
[17/12, 2:40 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): As if you've given another day to live
As if today you'll get to do things
You need to be selfish if you really want to be successful in spiritual field. And a selfish person have desires enough that he will not let others take advantage of them
The more I'm getting spiritual, the more aggressive I'm becoming in saving my rights
True spirituality is respecting yourself and to show others to not mess with you. Bcoz you love yourself.
Even the peaceful gods used powers against their enemies time to time
As per need
Like shiva
Who didn't flinched to open third eye when the enemies disturb him
Peace and sword go hand in hand
True peace comes from nuclear weapons
I think there are ways to detect narcissistic people, so, you can avoid them or prevent them way before
This + you can do gibberish and dynamic meditation
Try wild imagination
Punching your enemies
Breaking cars
Screaming
Expressing
Crying loudly
Basically, let yourself out in visualising
You know, when we fight with someone, physically, like Bruce Lee, they learn our fighting techniques and soon they'll get as perfect in fighting as you. They become what we are.
Similarly, when two person are walking, one speed will decrease according to the other.
When two person are talking, other becomes a reaction to another.
All examples of everyone is you pushed out
Moreover, sometimes when your friend say that exact line that you were about to say.
When you think about someone and they msg you
When you send a sign to someone in telepathy way
All signs of everyone is you pushed out
In mass movements, we don't see individuals. They all combine to become one. Just like when we say Canada. All the individuals in Canada becomes Canada.
Empathy is a sign that we can't see others in pain, bcoz we get pain seeing them in pain, bcoz somewhere we know, that they are us
Like moms say, that if you have eaten, then I have eaten
You are on right path my brother
Enjoy this beautiful journey
Actually everyone is on the right path, they just took long ways
[24/01, 2:06 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Thousands of people all over the world contemplating over law of attraction, onset of magnificent technologies like artificial intelligence, increase in global awareness/conscience, increase in desire for a good lifestyle all over the world...   Will all these converged to something big that is coming?
[24/01, 2:09 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Something that will intrinsically change this reality? Like never seen before? Thousand times magical like the current magical technologies we have.. Like the magical devices known as mobiles to talk with anyone in the world, like internet to share ideas with anyone and everyone in the world, sun like artifical light in houses, automatic cars, fast travels... Something that is Thousand times magical then all the technologies we have?
[25/01, 11:34 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Isn't it amazing in itself that among all species, only humans is the one that have so many things to enjoy. All other species are very basic.. Hunt eat sleep.. That's it
[25/01, 11:35 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Offcourse it complicated things too.. Now there are so many things and reasons to get sad too
[25/01, 11:35 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): But atleast there is variety
[26/01, 12:07 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): We have entered into the era of automation
[26/01, 12:07 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And technologies that will soon make harry potter world look meh and childish
I'm wasting time by - sleeping,
Others are wasting time by - job,
A rich person uses CA to solve his financial matters, Lawyer to solve his legal matters, private doctor for health matters, etc
Wealth - CA,
Health - private doctor,
Loa - motivator, psychiatrist, consultant,
..
Meta
overview
Zorba - why to do efforts
Tasking - how to do efforts
Buddha, wealth, health etc - use these to do those efforts
Two types of motivations -
To motivate yourself for that effort
To motivate yourself to want to motivate yourself
Desires and desiring  are useless without a way to fulfill them, and,  ways to fulfill things is useless without having desires to use those ways on
[10/02, 10:36 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Often poor people have desires but not the ways to fulfill them
And rich people have ways, but not the desires
[10/02, 10:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Those who balanced in both
[10/02, 10:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Are living the true life
Also.. When you have powers to fulfill desires, you'll get more desires..
[10/02, 10:39 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Isn't loa is one of the way
[10/02, 10:39 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Infact the most powerful one
[10/02, 10:39 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And meanwhile till you master loa, there are other ways
[10/02, 10:40 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Social skills, job, money, health, etc
Divide by
Divide those zorba.. By.. Strong, medium,..
Divide those zorba.. By high med low
Divide zorba by frequency of. High med low
Should I divide techs in zorba doc by how quickly effectively and long motivate me
Divide zorba by how much liberating , ..
Divide zorba by.. How much happy it made me in past, high, med, low... Days..  Also untried
Divide zorba techs to.. Those which left nothing to fantasise bcoz you've enjoyed them full in visualization, and those which..
Divide techs into confusing and..
Divide desires into sets in life, like clusters.. 
Cluster of desire no. 1
A gf with sex providing, abs, 1 lakh in bank, etc
Highly interesting
Medium interesting
Other interesting
Normal life
Type of desires - worldly, spiritual,
Move - there will still be.. To all desires
Move - unexpected similars.. To novelty
Move to taskish
Desires or motivation or motivation or interest for desires will not come when you are feeling lazy n powerless n helpless.. So, to spark ideas for desires or interest/motivation for desires, do things that will make you feel in charge, n not atleast lazy or hopeless or loser..., do things like, exercise, clean your room, little challenges n risks, efforts etc..  Bcoz you will only be interested in a desire only when you feel that you can get it
Vicious cycle
No. Of Efforts I did today - 2
Effort now for you may able to get yourself motivate tomorrow but then it will be late and less time and at that stage of motivation, you'll regret of wasting the time
You are not motivated now, and it's hard to motivate yourself now but what if you get motivation and reason to live in future.. Wouldn't you be upset of not working for things so that you could have those things earlier
Others
One benefits of teaching others dt zorba etc is that soon they'll help you in similar thoughts.. They'll themselves think of original thoughts soon which you can get huge benefits from in your zorba Buddha journey
with buddha and zorba techs in dt , also add the reddit thread link if you have shared them on reddit etc too
Schedule your zorba etc msgs scheduled in whatsapp group at exactly 11:11 time
Motivation 4 zorba
2 sec.. Zorba, when you don't have time to feel happiness from which tech
What's the use of finding zorba tech when in the end you'll end up adding it to zorba doc, then forgot about it, then start finding new
What's to live for? -
Worldly desires
Your happiness
Other people happiness?
Meaning?
I'm working bcoz of tensions or bcoz of desires?
Happiness from what matters, not only happiness
Get things first.. You can later decide on that they are worth or not..
Fulfill desires bcoz you can find later the reasonings to why to fulfill them bcoz you'll not get time later
I maybe hate happiness and love sadness bcoz only sadness and depression is evolving me and teaching me new ways and techs and motivations
Ask yourself after how many zorba techs will you get motivated for life
How many times do you need to motivate/discipline yourself this month - 30 times only
My life is struggling enough to keep me motivated and comfy enough..for the way i want to get my desires fulfilled
formatting
To the zorba techs, which can be useful for loa too, prefix or add a loa tag in them to later search for them
Zorba techs, use tricks to make sure they release all the happy chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins
Don't imagine all zorba techs as it is.. Like fun but as if they are making you happy /entertained etc from bored/sad etc
Find more standards of techs from the zorba doc.. And create a doc for list of standards
Visualise dt and desires.. Going hand in hand n dt getting modified n updated accordingly 
I may not get outer developments but lots of inner one like loa, dt etc
zorba is very useful in loa bcoz when you know what you want , loa gets easy
Zorba doc is not about future, it is about present. It is about interesting ways to interact with things in present such that future feels like worth living and life overall awesome and feel good
[13/03, 6:17 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You need a life where you sleep with feeling of gratitude and satisfaction and you wokeup with feelings of excitement
[13/03, 6:17 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Gratitude that what a beautiful day it was
[13/03, 6:22 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Excitement that what a beautiful day it will/can be
Sleeping with seratonin and waking with dopamine
Move
What what fitbit can do?
Can i use fitbit to recover points by detecting heartbeat
Record heartbeat overall day to find what what affected it
Fitbit with tasker, right after detecting heart beat increased from image, close the image, n open something else to distract you.. So as to get the desire into subconscious 
[15/12, 11:20 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Be as that it will not give you happiness but it would be nice to have it
[15/12, 11:39 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): This kills that attachment from the desire which you don't generally have with things that get easily manifest
[15/12, 11:40 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Some things easily get manifest bcoz you don't see them as capable to make you happy but that you feel like it would be nice still to have them
Don't force yourself about details.
Visualising don't need to be detailed
Universe know what you want
You don't need to tell it everything
Just like good moms know what their kids want
Even when the kid don't say anything
And universe is a good mom
The person is not just the physical details. They are a symphony of many many things bind together
Their character, their thoughts, their voice, their kindness, their...
Universe know who you have a crush on
Just like, when she is in the room, you don't realize you are looking at her but others do
You don't know but universe do
There is. But don't make it a burden
It should be a fun
Activity
Let your visualising go wild
Gta style
You know what I mean ??
Only then, the visualising will be genuine
In your wild in imagining, don't care about morals and laws
If you like her, imagine slapping all the opposing people that come between you and her. Roundabout kicks. Expressing loudly.
Full Tarzan
Express your heart out in your visualising
No shame, no morals
Go full jungli
If you want your visualising to be honest
And genuine
And interesting
Being in anger doesn't mean you don't love her. Anger is energy. It will add power to your visualising
Use everything
Even negative emotions
In universe, everything is useful
Only one who've seen 50 shades of black, know about 50 shades of grey
No, only beleives. You beleive that good mood is needed to attract things
Whereas any mood can be used to attract anything
That's why bad people are successful too
Bcoz even though they don't deserve things, they still get, bcoz they see themselves as good
Or they don't beleive that being bad will not give them results
Bcoz you are too much into her. Girls are scared of being in someone's life so much that they don't care anything bcoz they fear that if a person put them on a pedestal, what if, they take them back
The day you'll get over her, is the day she may attract to you
Focus on other desires
Right now, she feels that she is the only fun of your life. Make your life such fun that she will know that your life is fun with or without her, and she then would want to join those fun with you
You don't need to meditate sitting, you can do it laying
You can do it for just 5 min
You don't need to be continuous in your meditation
You can use timer app
More good. Your meditation tech will become a loa tech
It is called SATS
Loa kinda tech by neville
Just think of your desire as fulfilled in meditation
And if you sleep, it will be beneficial
Dreams - Tea, pebble,
Dreams - aquarium big room, quarrel with ddy, Anchal and car, kadahi n ppl
Doc - my unpopular opinions /interests - i stand for tiktok,.. 
move
Ask fortune not for you only but for your kids n grandkids that will come
-----------------------------
Risky
Excuse – other [contradictory] is more fancy or getting affected by it 
Managing w.r.t other contradictory desires :
Mediocrity vs ..
mix
[move to] Living like Buddha 
To add [to the above list]
In the list to do efforts for ; for an awesome daily life
Slowly-2
----------------------
=================================
============
Imagine yourself using it to run from yourself, as a distraction, immersing
Is this that bored tech?
You are broken. Work from there.
You are..
What a fuckin great distraction
From responsibilities
From struggles
From boredom
From struggle of finding meaning in life
As if break from searching for meaning of life
As if you were happy before n not sad n not.. To be happy bcoz you were already. You'll be open.., n rest unexpected similars
Not started it as a sad or complaint man but happy already before coming to it
N not seeing it as if it will make you happy from sad or bored but.. Added maybe to happiness already
And you have these with you - bt speaker music, mobile, friend/s,..
Happy, satisfied, content
As if happy from..
Overall happy
Imagine yourself using it to feel whole life as good. It's good its good. Single images first then combine random or sequence 
A future where you have lots of things to use to feel good about the whole life one item at a time
Island
Introvert
All desires in that place
Avoid some desires
Big room
Like harem
Using other ways to enjoy other desires
Amazon
Dating through online and girls coming
Arrange parties at that home
Also earning money from there
Multiple homes? Or flying house? Airbus
When you have such house.. You wouldn't mind going outside occasionally.. With knowledge that soon you'll be at home
Occasional outings like tasks way
What about travel? People go outside to make them fall in love with their house again.., also travel to find which elements to add to your house. You try to find happiness outside bcoz you couldn't find it at home.
It's evolutionary too.. Bcoz a human wants food roof and security
Maybe that's why fight for lands, maybe that's why palaces etc..
Maybe that's why antilla
Home sweet home, nothing like home
House having all types of goodness
Like heaven
Five such houses in the world? 
Also change the city you live in
Occasional Meetings at home
Walls with big screens
Interior designers
Automation
Like neverland ranch
Workers who will automatically add new things and gadgets to house. Personalised.
A wardrobe for woman, sexy clothes, for sex
Fresh teen girls daily
Bcoz of chutiya house of jf n ddy, I forgot it's all about house
Houses stores energies.. Long and the house itself will nurture you.. Atomic habits.. Environment shapes you..
Like a king
Non judgemental workers or Mbti compatible or robots with artificial intelligence
Background music that follows you all around the house
Library, dancing room, gym, harem, theatre,
N not any of these at home - ddy, toxic people, jf, chutiya neighbours nearby,..
Many things in home to distract you.. Many fun things.. 
What if you finding that the billion dollar house you will buy also have this n this n this.. Etc n can helps/enables directly indirectly attracts this n this n this.. Etc
Unexpected similars
You can use those thousands of downloaded images of Tumblr, insta and other porn in your randomiser.. If too many for mobile, create sets.. And change sets if you get bored of one set..
In that image randomiser, see one image as starter and rest as things that you'll get bcoz of it.. Like a sequence.. Unexpected.. B from a, c from b etc
Choose a base object (ex home) that you want and use it as a starter.. No need to add it in randomiser but still use it in randomiser to associate
In that randomiser image thingie, first see if single images attracts you, then combine..
=================== 1
just do tasks and see life get changed simultaneously
see decade age of 20s as your building up for awesome 30s
use idea amap.. Use every idea of dt amap
Only little successes will show you importance of higher successes
It's fun and opportunity to get to fulfill dreams of your family
Be happy that on earth atleast these things are not common -
Awesome setup - me
Sometimes we need solutions and clearance.. When the reality gets too confusing.. And sometimes we need little mystery and vagueness when the reality gets too simple and straight
Isn't it saddening to know that your parents will not be with you near your death bed
Daily list of new things I enjoyed today
New things (28 feb 20) -
Things they must be knowing
Bold the ideas in passions doc
Imagine after getting it, how long will it feel new
I'm aditya, not udit, udit version 2
Those who have resources don't know ideas and desires to enjoy it or very basic, and those who don't but got little exposure of it, know multiple ways to enjoy it by the power of imagination
Life is a beautiful song. Its just we are playing in Chinese headphone
Imagine a future where you are always excited for tomorrows
I'm thankful for chkpix. It helped me numerous times in restoring pc tasks after crashing
Imagine Lightning up their day. Making them untethered and feel good for the day. Making them love themselves
Remind those people who have resources, multiple interesting ideas/desires/potential/ways to use those resources before they lose those resources and life
Chk - suffix each doc title with number of big ideas in it
? - Imagine the potential of perfectness in it
What would he do if in place of me.. So, be proud of yourself.. Today
Those of you who hate life that it is not going well, what if it haven't started yet
Am I no fun? Like they are doing?
configurability like loa - social skills ,
Maybe I'm saving energy by not enjoying some desires
That present/future tech is the real way to gratitude
Things that added newness recently into my life that I efforted for - automating sites opening,
Imagine starting using all those ideas together.. How they'll start changing your world together.. Not results as per but the change they'll create..
Multitask your egos.. Work to be many people
Making use of past things
I'm on earth to understand life, not that much to enjoy it meaninglessly
i love myself..he so much want me to be happy and complete. The incessant journey efforts and intentions.
Choose your battles
The whole world is simultaneously efforting for future..
Chk - that environment tech.. Setups
Help people..
Excel, bad things that happened and lesson or big idea i get from them
from the goodreads quote page you liked , get most freq tags
get goodreads most freq tags , choose the ones you like and add in that randomiser
you can savor a thing like tea after finishing it too...like the aftertaste etc and the very fresh memories
living body experiencing living moments
Do those things first which will create time for you. So that you'll get to do more things in New time
if you want to share whatsapp link in other groups , share with some other message that is relatable and in tune with the group/people/friendliness so that they will not outrightly see you as a spammer or bot. Iykwim
Rename deity to dt
reminder - a note under mobile cover with address etc
reminder - a note under purse with address etc
--------
I'm using this life well.
Gaming bcoz artifical characters to connect with, bcoz connections,
An app to upload your pic and it will create interesting alter egos with stories
No matter the richness , the old kings don't have things like mobiles etc , so you don’t be sad of not having advanced pc like others have..
Automation
Not moving but improving or bettering
What will make you feel big and many results in life
Imagine how the greed of this desire feels
Visualise yourself immersed in enjoying your desire
Immersion
Bulb creates positivity in room , like streethouse
Jot that down
------------------------
Imagine a future where you are highly intuitive and ready
A future where you can afford mistakes
Why effort or live for future when life is or if in future you can't -  [imagine a future/one-desire[sx] consisting of these elements]
happiness should include -
Basic future
Future level 1
Future level 2
Future level 3
====================== desires
get desires now] Novelty [newness , liking , new things , big-ideas, Risking , gamblingish , powers and desires , future , egos , ]
------------------- same
When the world around you will be basically same
When the ppl around you will be basically same
When the things around you will be basically same 
When it is mix of bland and boring days 
When it is predictable
-------------------- newness , 
Visualise It adding newness into your life
Visualise It making you new
New/upgraded adityas
Visualise It adding newness to you
As long you are old, happiness etc wouldn't matter
It's refreshing
A true happiness or success should change you
There is no development if you remain the same
Alter egos?
You being new > happiness
Maybe divide zorba techs by what will make me feel new more
A tech should change you
This is like reincarnation
Which makes you forget your old you
That old you, new you tech
Not just external changes but inside
Best way to be new is to forget old
I'm the life I'm living
Visualise It adding newness into your life
Things that had added newness into your old life for some time - sector house,
This is exactly why a zorba tech looks stale after some time, bcoz, it stops looking lucrative after adding newness into your life or after you've finished enjoying the newness it added into your life
Just know that the newness it will add into your life will not be permanent and it shouldn't be otherwise you'll get stagnant
We seek for some change
Enjoy the newness while it lasts. You'll return to baseline after sometime
Newness into hour, day, month, year, life. Porn will add newness into your life for an hour, a gf will add newness for 3-4 months
Newness, freshness
This tech will help in the sense that now you'll know how much to expect from something
Depression is when you try to extend that newness bcoz that newness is natural and spontaneous
These will add newness for 3-4 months - car, gf,
These will add newness for few minutes - tasty unhealthy food, fapping /porn
With time, the duration of newness of things will decrease maybe. This is known as desensitization maybe. And there is nothing wrong in it, this is known as growing up n evolution
Maybe, This tech also makes you accept that your life is sad and stale and..
See images in that randomiser and use this tech or check how long will be the newness stays
Anything is meh and boring if you try to see or expect newness from it for a duration it can't give
Newness instead of happiness
Newness into the hour for an hour
Newness into the life for an hour
Newness into life or hour and how much
See the amount of newness it will add to your life and for what amount of time the newness will feel new
Be as if it is adding newness into your life
See images or randomiser with this tech for help in imagining
Group things or desires or tasks by how much newness and for how long it add to your life
Loa - Imagine you with it and you feeling/enjoying the newness it have temporarily added to your life
It added so much newness into my life
-------------------- likingness
Imagine a future where you can't beleive you've did this or achieved this or it happened to you
Everyone likes to live with a hero of some kind. Some kind of superhero or someone in charge and guidance. Someone with heroic deeds and abilities. So, why not you be a hero yourself..
Wouldn't you like a future where you found that you are capable of things you never thought in past you could be
Be the hero of your story. Wouldn't you want to see yourself in future as a hero and winner of your story then a victim and sufferer.
Imagine how it feels to suddenly find big reasons to fall in love with yourself
Imagine you overheard strangers talking great things about someone and you found out they are talking about you.. Like.. How he achieved that, how he persisted for that, or how he is being a great influence, or how they feel safe bcoz of him, or how he is a role model to their kids and you suddenly found out they are talking about you
Imagine a life where you are finding sudden reasons to love yourself more
Things for which even you can't beleive that you've did them but you did
Such that you feel like want to be jealous of yourself kinda..
Like be as if you get reasons to be jealous of yourself..
[09/02, 1:08 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Think that if your past little self would feel proud of the current you or not?
[09/02, 1:08 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): For the things you've achieved
[09/02, 1:08 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Of the efforts you did
Imagine you seeing yourself being spontaneous and in flow of being awesome
Be as if you are jealous of yourself
Be as if you are confident in your swag
Mastermind
Baazigar
Game changer
Chupa rustam
One who is master in not only that but that too
Imagine people slowly coming to conclusion of your greatness
Imagine you stumbling over the artifacts of your greatness
As if luck is helping you such such that it feels like it's you
Guts
Gutsy things you did - jatin help in tuition and class, approached 3 girls,
Randomise from the list of guts to show every month randomly
Forget it after doing it but schedule it for surprise factor
Such that it feels like someone else
Imagine finding your alter Ego have achieved so much without you knowing and that you get to know one day.. The success and success stories.. Just like a parent feels proud to know suddenly of their kids successes
Imagine finding one day about this person named Shahrukh khan and how he is one of your alter Ego
See any girl pic or car pic and feel how it feels to know that your alter Ego have tapped it or possess it
Imagine seeing a pic and finding that your alter Ego or your followers or managers have arranged/convinced/ordered/paid it for you
Imagine you efforted for it in a flow /frenzy and unconsciously and now you own it and is conscious of it and enjoying it savouringly
Imagine you in a hotel with that beautiful girl and suddenly realizes that you've efforted for her and is in hotel with a beautiful girl now
And another you switch over now who remembers the techs written in onenote to love her in multiple interesting ways
Better one switch over and the girl gets more happy
Be as if you are highly energized/refreshed/charged to enjoy the desire
As if you forgot the efforts you did to get it and now it feels like a lottery or prize n you just can't wait to taste it
As if you forgot it is there
As if you were waiting/gambling/hoping/praying/eager for this moment/opportunity
As if you didn't thought how you'll enjoy it, you just have postponed the thinking of how you'll enjoy it
When you know how you'll enjoy it, it ruins all the mystery. So, either don't think before, the ways you'll enjoy it, or don't think of all the ways but few.. Unexpected similars
And maybe while enjoying it, think of how you didn't thought of these ways to enjoy it
See picture of a random beautiful girl from Tumblr insta etc and try this tech
This is loa and zorba
Maybe - Be as if you are confused about how to enjoy it among multiple ways
This tech will make you want/crave/need it. And you'll think about it automatically
You knew you'll enjoy it but you didn't thought of how how you'll enjoy it
Like you sudden realizing after bringing her home the numerous seemingly unlimited ways to enjoy her
You can use this for pceing motivation, procrastination and tasks.. Don't think how how you'll enjoy pceing .. Know that you'll enjoy pceing for sure but don't think how how
Copy or link this tech under sex doc too
Just that it is enjoyable, highly enjoyable and in possibly multiple ways
Porn -
I know it is enjoyable
I know it can be enjoyable in multiple ways
I'm not thinking of those ways now
I have it but i'll enjoy it later
Try this tech with - bindu, sex, girls, car,
As if you are taking a risk
Owned or enjoyed by if not me, then similar to me.. Like my kid etc
Visualise a future where you are not just already passionate in things but easily can increasingly increase/improve your passion in things
Where you can easily change your passions
Switching
Increase, decrease
Don't imagine a future full of things you are passionate about..
Bcoz that is not that liberating
Instead, think of a future where you are capable /able to be passionate in anything if not already, to freely be able to increase your passion in anything you want to.
Gamble I'll like it or not.. Don't pre beleive that you'll not like it. What if you'll like it
Be happy that there are so many things you can play this gamble on
Create a list of them in which gamble win
Issue is you judge a thing before, that it will be meh.. And by loa, it actually becomes meh
Check if I have this concept written in that gamble tech
Dopamine isn’t the “pleasure chemical.” You see the misconception all the time. Someone indulges in their favorite vice and says “gotta get my dopamine rush!” But dopamine isn’t about pleasure, it’s about craving.
Our dopamine levels don’t spike when we get something we want, they spike when something we want becomes available, and go down once we actually get the pleasurable thing.
Dopamine isn’t the rush of driving fast; it’s the green light that tells you to go
Novelty (dopamine)
Others (oxytocin)
Serotonin (mood)
Endorphins (
Tech based on dopamine) Imagine a future where you are postponing the fun..
Where it is available but you haven't started enjoying/cashing it
The excitement, anticipation
Where you are sure that you will like it and it will make/up your mood (Serotonin)
Many things, more good
Imagine it is available and you getting ideas of how how to/you-can enjoy it
But that it is not constantly available
Cravings
Imagine you thinking about it, of enjoying it..
And it becomes available (not available or it was busy somewhere)
Delay it
Imagine you want something n you come to know you'll get to enjoy it after 5 min for 5 min and then it go and come after 5 min.. On and on
Imagine you are enjoying something you like, n It go before you get bored of it, but comes, before you 
Tea, vaibhav tea,
Make that thing multi factorial
Is this batch results tech
What if this happens daily
Note - You get dopamine only for few seconds after you get to know it's available, and only when you know you liked it, and will surely enjoy it, also that you know ways to enjoy it creatively
That girl appear disappear tech.. Link it here
Imagine yourself craving for it
Project repair your dopamine receptors and pathways -
Nofap
Detox
Do boring things every morning and boringly
..
Note - why - it is a way to make yourself motivated.
When you don't even know how the emotion of happiness n excitement feels
[11/01, 11:48 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Watch this playlist if you ever feel depressed or forgot how being excited feels
[11/01, 11:48 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And know that there can be a future where you may feel excited similarly
[11/01, 11:48 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): It helps living in the end
Schedule the happy crowd, adrenaline kinda youtube playlists in that chrome randomiser regular opener..
Image randomiser, imagine finding yourself really liking it
Use bad images to make you hate..
Image randomiser, Be as if you need it, n unexpected similars
As if it is an elegant solution to what you needed
A future where I love my life. Absolutely. Live until you come to a time where you absolutely love your life
I love my life now too, but live such that you love it more n more
[12/12, 4:27 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): In drawings, we draw and color until we really like the result. Same with life
[12/12, 4:28 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Live.. Live and do things to improve it until you really like the end result
[12/12, 4:28 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And meanwhile enjoy the journey.. Just like we enjoy the process of drawing and coloring
[12/12, 4:30 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And just like the color black, even depression is useful
[12/12, 4:31 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Use it to give contrasts

Motivations 4 this tech - 
Things for which i wasn't happy once - my body, computer, shoes,
Visualise yourself feeling happy about it
How it feels to be happy of so many things
Maybe meaning of life is to be happy of amap things simult
So that you get to feel more n more happy about it
I want to feel good about so many things
How it would feel to feel good about..
Maybe to motivate yourself in negative or reverse psychology way, imagine yourself feeling bad or have to feel bad about..
Happy n tension free
Feel good, feel bad
Spontaneously and effortlessly, not deliberately
Maybe health etc would be too vague and you can never be feeling good about it fully. And so, you wouldn't want to do efforts for it. So, include in small goals, like weight, eyes, etc
tasks that will make me feel really good abt something
Even if you get generally happy, it will not help you feeling happy about particular something if you aren't feeling happy about it
Find when will you be feeling good about it
--------
This is meta tech. Techs of tech. Bcoz goal of all and any tech ultimately is to make you feel good about life etc
This is zorba and Buddha both
This is all inclusive, common sense technique
Normal problem solving is like this too. Feeling bad about something.. You solve it to not feel bad about it
Main goal is not just to enjoy sex, main goal is to feel happy about sex. If you enjoyed sex, and still felt sad or bad or unhappy about it later, it's of no use. Like with sex with prostitute
You are not happy in one general way but in parts.. Like about things.
-------------------- new things
You are bored bcoz You see the world as same but
Not all houses are totally same

..
Beautiful Setups I created -
Android
Pc
Almira
Eventghost
Note - instead of things,.. Setups, environment, structure
Complex and sophisticated
Work for a life with better versions of things you use daily. You use these things daily these days - Pc, bed, house, bike, sector park, mobile, family, girls hope, chair, clothes, glasses, websites, body/health, mind, apps, loa hope, voice, money, food, cat, sleep, people, toilet, dt, onenote, eyes,
Sort by use
-------------------- big-ideas
Imagine you getting/trying game-changing/revolutionary/big idea in fields like in sex, tea, books, dt, onenote, jogging etc etc
Average ideas bore you..  Infact they are the reason of your boredom
Seemingly game changing or big
Or be as if the idea is big
Just like so many ideas from only 10 images in that randomiser
In Epiphany style
Epiphanies, zinkies, bulb on head
Ex,
Bt speaker on boat with boat standing by itself in middle of nainital 
Car mods in gta, Cleo etc
Web scraping ideas
Interesting fun Position ideas while missionary
Imagine all these ideas one at a time coming to you like a surprise/Epiphany
So, there is approx atleast 10 big ways/ideas to enjoy park
Create list of every activity/thing with number/count of big ideas to enjoy it
Imo, the count is unlimited bcoz of combinations probabilities permutations etc, so, just keep the current count
Enjoy every as if this is the fresh big idea
Dividing techs by strongness (high, med, low) is this tech in disguise
Only big ideas, and not average ideas
Some ideas may seem only big in start but not later
Detox yourself of old big ideas time to time so that they feels new and big again.. Like stop listening to music in park
Maybe sometimes not fulfill/try those new big ideas so that life keep interesting and there are things for future. But for present fun, also try some. Keep a balance in amount of trying how many new ideas
Maybe in excel, write after how many days if detox will you crave it again, or it start feeling like new/big again
Column - number of untried big ideas
Park big ideas -
What if video recording or pic capturing every 3 seconds
What if a socks there

[02/03, 4:30 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Life is about big ideas. Not average ideas. Big ideas make life interesting. Get big ideas in everything, in every field.
[02/03, 4:31 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Average ideas are dangerous bcoz they make you see everything as average
[02/03, 4:31 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Try to think big ideas bcoz once you get big ideas, the thing will immediately became exciting
[02/03, 4:32 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): We think good life is about ideas but forgot to distinct them from average and big
Imagine a future where you have many many big ideas to try and you feel impatient and excited
Imagine a future with lots and lots of big (not average) ideas
Computer big ideas - maybe start playing portal 2, or xxx games in it,
Big ideas - health - nofap
Imagine a life full of big ideas
Imagine you get to try 10 big ideas everyday
Those are big ideas which will give unknown new kind of big results
Maybe big ideas tech will help in Loa too bcoz persistent interest

Life exists out of your comfort zone
98% of people don't take risks and are therefore aren't successful like 2%
Actual special changes happen bcoz of path of risk, road less travelled
Maybe Risks doesn't need to be unplanned and unthought but calculated n safe.  Which are risky to my other contradictory desires but not that much.  With time, increase the amount of risk factor
It is not that big risk , but a small part of life
I need to prove …
No need to take big risk at start, practice taking small risks and than increase risk factor with time n confidence
Take risks , they will teach u more and uniquely New 
future is a gamble.. Be the gambler
What-2 to see as gambles-
What to use the gambling technique for - tasks, risks maybe, desires,..
See the gambles you won, for example, some things you are enjoying right now, you once were not sure that you can and you will achieve them, but you did.. It's like you won those gambles of surity and unsureity

Note - not something that happened by itself or something that I like after it happened n not before
Maybe - Things of which I know value of before, n not after
Note - not how long disturbed by the problem, but how long for the solution
This will make you feel powerful and you'll get new desire ideas only when you feel powerful..
Maybe group by recent (bcoz i remember the effort), those of which I remember the effort, n those which i don't
Mental and physical struggle
These were like projects once
Researches that fulfilled
see her as a gamble
This way, you'll not see her as a certainty
And not as someone impossible to get
Bcoz we either see that girl as a certainty or impossible
But when you see her as a gamble, you'll see both sides
And this is a gambling with nothing at stake
You just have to approach and play this gamble
And when you see the approaching as a gamble of win n loss, the whole ordeal will become fun
That girl is a gamble
- For we don't know that she will like you or not
- For we don't know she is good from inside or not
- for we don't know that she is already interested in you or not
And other questions like that
Main thing is she is a gamble
And *I'M A GAMBLER*
I'm a gamble
Birthing out of many sperms is a gamble in itself
Just like every technique is a gamble. You may set with it or not
Driving on roads is a gamble in itself
Evolution is a gambling
Loa, it is a gamble too
Everything I do is a kind of gamble
Tasks, they are like gamble too, that you may like them or not
Going to pc is like gamble too
Life is gambles
Learning is a gamble
My height is a gamble
Everything is a gamble
Universe is gamble
This tech is gamble
Their height is a gamble too
Future is gamble
It will accomplish or not is a gamble
I'll like the results or not is also a gamble
I'll get new desires in future or not is also a gamble
Doing the tech even if it doesn't seem profitable or meaningful or even if you can't do it properly is gambling in itself too
How to -
Your efforts are a gamble bcoz it's not sure that they will result or not and positively bcoz the desire/target/task is difficult 
See how your efforts were a gamble
Trying is gambling
Your effort/s is a gamble for you don't know it will result or not, and in desired way or not
Sometimes my effort/s bring positive results but not all times. So, that’s why they are gambles
The goal is to see where that interest takes you. It may end after one sentence. One text. One week. One decade. But you don't know. And you will only know by going up to that attractive girl that keeps catching your eye with the intent of sexual interest.
You worry that your efforts will be succesful or not
It will be a big gamble
Only those things with high failure rates (which you fear of failing in or screwed up in) are gambles 
Only difficult things are gambles
More difficult it is, more good bcoz more fun the gambling, more gamblish factor, more fun to use loa
The gambling of efforts and luck
Idk about the results.. It's kind of gamble.. Only trying is the way
See history of successful gambling to know how to gamble
I have been gambling all along
See the victories in little little gambles in daily life
Think about the gambles you'll get to play in next hour, tomorrow
Gamble, what if..
What if you win this gamble easily
I'll take all these gambles
To drop bad habits, be as if.. I'm stopping it and see what happens as a gamble.. For example, while fapping.. Drop it n be.. Bcoz not either certain or uncertain
Maybe - See the gambles you may lose in if you fap,..
Maybe - don't speculate too much before gambling
Maybe - don't speculate before gambling
I think I'm losing gambling soul
Why - 
Gambling makes winning a lot fun
It gives you confidence
Gambling tech will make you productive
Gambling tech will make you in flow and spontaneous
Similarly, the desires, you have in present, see them as gambles too, bcoz they might happen or not happen, but you'll effort for them, just like gamblers do, not bcoz they know they'll win in their efforts, but bcoz it is fun
Your desires are not certain to get fulfilled, but if you see them as gambles, it will be fun
Even if you prepared diligently, it is still a gamble bcoz luck
Gambles bcoz No technique can give certainty in happiness n fulfilment n satisfaction
A person can win gamble even if he loses it
Even if you failed, you'll be happy that you gambled
Most games are just gambling factor in disguise
You can't do tasks, desires etc bcoz you either over expect or not expect at all.. Seeing them as gambles is the solution
By this tech, you'll not set unnecessary expectations from the world and life.. Since you'll see everything as gamble
You'll get chill and will not over force yourself
don't see future as expected, fixed or rigged.. No matter however your past was or present is bcoz when you see future as a gamble, you are giving universe permission to work it's magic
Seeing them as gambles broadens the scope of results
Ego, gambling tech works maybe by giving universe a chance to dance by suspension of your beliefs and biases
Seeing it as gambling is like giving chance to universe to show it's presence, dance and help you bcoz there is option for universe, a kind of freedom
Winning in gambles shows luck
It's like karam kar , phal ki chinta mat karr
Most of the success is just showing up
Sometimes just show up.. It's like that. Showing up
Just show up
Winning the results is a bonus
There are so many interesting gambles
More gambles, more you'll be successful in life bcoz you taking risks n chances
Gambling helps you execute your plans
Gambling is made a bad word as a conspiracy..
What's the gambling in being lazy
Gamble, daily, reset, gurgaon
Main thing is gambling
Death is so terribly final and future is full of possibilities
Small gambles
Maybe don't take risks..start from small gambles
I'm a gambler
Gambling in terms of race against time
See everything as unpredictable
It's a gambling to do/expect doing it without it.. Bcoz i think it's necessary for it
I'm already
Passively
Living dangerously
Meta gamblings
See the gamblings in others.. Others doing gamblings.. Etc.. Like she is a gamble for she is interesting or boring.. See the other as gamble bcoz they are
Maybe - gambling but calculated
Gambling over..
Your desire is a gamble for you don't know how much you gonna like it.. What if that desire make you proud of choosing to do efforts for it, what if that desire exceeds your expectations, what if you super like that desire
That desire is a gamble
And so, your effort or decision to pursue it is an investment you are doing
No one really knows the full effects of a decision before taking it, we can only guess from our previous experiences but often future always contains something new, so, we truly can't measure all the factors
That's why, I say, those desires are gambles
Albeit beautiful gambles sometimes
For example, this loa thingie, i really underestimated it before just like all normal "sane" people do.. But my experimental nature alongside with my failures to find solace in all other mainstream religions led me to try something untraditional and untried. And oh boy, if I hate and love the old me.. Hate for doubting this loa thingie and love for deciding to try something new
Only when I tried loa, i come to know new higher level of sanity and new wisdom.. One Two people telling me against it and i might not have tried loa but instead of deciding to do loa or not according to the old beleifs and facts, the openmindedness to try something out of box always in a gamblish way give beautiful results
You all are here bcoz you decided to stop the normal decider in you for brief amount of time, and you let the supreme decider in you to take over and try something new that is loa
And this supreme decider is your gut voice, your voice of instincts, the feeling in the bone, that hunch, that intuition, the calling from unknown
Listen to it bcoz it sometimes know what's best for you
Einstein said, that we can't decide something on the same level.. (we can't solve a problem being on the same level of the problem..) (like trying to read a science book written in English without completing English course first.. Only when we are proficient in English.. Can we truly understand what the science book written in English is saying)... Same way, we don't always know what's best for us in long run.. That's where the supreme decider in you comes into play and importance..
But
People are scared to follow it bcoz these days there are so many voices inside
Voice of media, voice of subconscious ads cleverly incepted in you, voice of deep old beliefs, biases etc
So, first learn to know, which voice is truly your true wellwisher
But if you take your time (give time to yourself), you may come to know which voice is that true voice
And than, there is only elevation in life in all sorts of dimensions.. Overall growth
E N L I G H T E N M E N T
Some other voices that are good for you -
'- a good friend
'- a good book
'- your emotions too guides you
'- your sharp intuitive intelligence to see the unseen in ordinary
'- experiment the shit out of things
Etc
Try the effort
Try this effort for you don't know you may start to like it.. Right now you don't
Effort for the desire is a gamble bcoz you don't know that what if you like the effort, or what if she positively exceeds your expectations,
The desire itself is a gamble for the results could get amazing
That thing/desire is a gamble for you don't know that you'll like it or not, and how much, and in what ways,
You don't do many efforts for many things bcoz you only do for things which you are sure that you'll like.. For things, that you are unsure that you will like them or not, you don't want to do efforts. But for new things which we haven't tried before, we can't or don't know shit, and so, this tech will make you venture into new capitals
Where the earlier point
I go to park to..
That pera I shared on whatsapp
Gamble bcoz i dont know fully about the desire
Gamble bcoz i dont know/sure i like it or not or how much or in what way
That thing is a gamble bcoz you don't know that -
It will meet your expectation or not
It is what you expected or not
Not over the expectation, but that, it will meet the basic expectation you have from it.
Like expecting girls in park, you also go to park to see beautiful girls, but not always, there are girls
For example, from lemonade, you expect it to be cold, proportioned, tasty, fulfilling,..
Maybe - And so this tech is fun bcoz you see randomness in things that high chance will come good only
That it will be same or similar as I am desiring/thinking/hoping or not (not over or under..) 
Dejavu
Nothing is certain.. Even the basic is uncertain
Gamble on
Coming to park was the gamble
Park will be gamble for you don't know it would have that or not
See it as lottery for you don’t where it would lead you
See it as a gamble/lottery for you don’t know what-2 comes out-of/from it. Like from future/girl/chasing-that-girl/..
This is a gamble too
Gamble bcoz you don't know or guess the results.. What results, how many results, type of results, etc
Gamble, limit, can't say it's impossible to get her, gamble below impossible, it is a gamble between the limits, maximum that can happen is or couldn't happen is..
It is a Gamble till failure
It's all fun and games until..
It is not impossible but
Big gamble
It is a gamble bcoz i'm jeopardizing many things for it
It is a gamble bcoz all the efforts can go waste, or futile, or infertile or backfire maybe . No guarantee it will work out. So, don't think much and jump in. 
This will make you not too much judge or expect from your efforts bcoz mostly it stops you from doing efforts
All the efforts, preparations, techniques, etc can go null or waste
For ex, if you feel lazy in getting up and sitting on pc, the effort to get in flow of pc may fail.. Thats why it's gamble
Winning is a gamble in this
See it as a gamble for you can't guess what will happen next in it..
You can't guess anything at all
You can't imagine anything what's next in it
That's why gamble
See it as something like that
Something which you have no clue about
You would want to start it than
You don't know what will happen in it, less good or bad, nothing at all, not a shred of info
Be/act like that
Be as if it is a gamble (something about which you have not even a fuckin clue about) even if it is not
You can't see anything in it
As if you don't know what is it
Be as if it is like a total gamble
Totally unknown/newish
It will make you spontaneous
What if i win this, win in it
This is written before.. Find it
All these positive what ifs
Simple gamble
Yes or no
Only 2 options
More options more complex
Win or lose
Since I'm unprepared (or not fully prepared) for this, it'll be a gamble
It is gamble bcoz it is confusing
Everything is gamble for different reasons
Do/start it to see if it is/was/will be (a) gamble or not n how much gamble
I don't know it will be worth or not to go in/through/do/start it.. Thats why (see) it as a gamble
Be as if you don't know..
Was
Only time/results will tell
Try it as a gamble.. With results not guaranteed
The techniques are a gamble for that. May or may not work
It is a gamble bcoz you don't know where it may lead you (eventually, finally) (linearly, compound effect, exponentially) 
To see where it will/may lead you
Be as if you don't know where it may/will lead you even if you know, even if it is nothing new, regular etc
Be as if it will lead to something nice
Do/start it to see where it may lead you
Where where it may lead me and how much
It is a gamble bcoz you don't know how many lotteries hidden in it
Be as if there are lotteries hidden in it even if it is a daily regular thingie
Lotteries doesn't necessarily mean money only
Be as if it have opportunities, random, what if,
Bcoz you don't know what opportunities will be in it
Life is a gamble/uncertain and maybe doing/starting/chasing it will help in ..
You don't know you should pursue it or not bcoz your overall life/future seems bad/meh but know that life is a gamble and it may help in that
Your life will remain a gamble even if you do these or not -
This thingie
..
that's why you righteosuly said in the beginning of this tech that "future is a gamble"
This doesn't mean to take high and risky risks but this is to make yourself confident where you shouldn't be feary too much or where you are scared over the top and unnecessarily
Do/start/.. It bcoz future already and always have-been/is/will-be in shambles/gambles.
In big picture
future is a gamble
it was/is/will-be never certain and sure
so , why thinking too much doing that thing or not
bcoz even if you do or don't , future will still be a gamble
an uncertainity
a mysteriousness
nothing you do or not do will not decide your future bcoz it is big and mysterious
so , don't procrastinate and just do it
====================================
Try that future, try those results , those results from that are gamble in the sense that I may like them or not and how much like..
Try those results
Even if you have tried those results.. Be as if you haven't..
I wanna try these results - gfs, big house, cars,..
Those result are gamble [that I want to play] in sense that I may like them or not and how much
It is a gamble of only 2 mintues.. Its clear after that.. The confusions and clarity
Everything is a gamble in starting
Only initially gamble
Temporarily gamble
It is a gamble for few mintues only.. Clearer after that
Be with it till it is a gamble
Find gamble in it
It is fun only till it's a gamble
Gamble to success in it
It is an automatic gamble.. Just show up.. And it may itself gamble out.. Just do that much only and see it gambling itself out.. Like that superlotto machine 
Gamble distinct for each
What if she - 
Is not - 
Stereotypical like other girls
Conservative
Is -
is into loa too,
sexy inside,
wild on bed,
love your humour n intelligence,
doesn't care that much about your joblessness,
not greedy,
help you get girls,
immediately fall in love with you,
That girl is an interesting gamble or puzzle or Russian doll for you don't know what's inside. She is maybe like a gift box or Pandora box you haven't opened yet
Not What if she is .. But what if she is not..
==
Be as if you are trying it, not doing it
What if she is fun
What if she is the one
It gives you freedom to do things
What if I win in this gamble , what if I win that gamble
Now you want to get into the gamble or start that gamble
What if luck will help me in that gamble
Prepare/go/effort for it As if luck is/will-be fully with you, as if only positive results, as if winning for sure
You don't know how it will feel.. It is kind of gamble. Doc - gambles , later check that was it worth the effort or not.
everything get easy to start if instead of before , you decide to check later or after that it was wortht the effort or not
usually , before starting anything , we fall into the mistake or trap of evaluating that whether it or results from it will be worth our efforts or not.. but if you decide that you will evaluate that later after doing it , anything gets supereasy to start
you will suddenly find easy to take risks
as you grow up , you been told by elders etc to evaluate or judge things before doing..this is good but it is double edge sword for it will kill your spontaneity and risks taking abilities for there is no good results in life without taking risks and without showing up and without starting things
the method i shared above will kick the procrastination habit right in the nuts
What if i win the gamble
See the number of available gambles to play
Gambles in the current situation or time
Simultaneous gambles
See that opportunities available in the present moment technique
It is a gamble where I'll try my luck to see it's worth continuing or not
It will be a gamble to see it will be worth continuing or not
Try this gamble, just reject or stop if you don't like
It's a gamble if you are totally unprepared, not if you are.. More unprepared you are, more good
How many Gambles I gambled today and how many I'm proud/like that I gambled them
See Things with good results as a gambled you played.. This will create motivation in you
Gamble
Gambles in her
Spontaneous
Surprises
Unexpected
She is not a gamble yet
This day is a gamble or not yet
Live as if each day is a gamble
Rest of the day is a gamble bcoz Anything good or bad can happen in it/next-hour, while it..
For something big n good may/can happen before it ends
It may/can end with something savorable/memorable/..
Be excited bcoz Anything can happen in the rest of the day
Gambles that I played that I like bcoz of good results later - keto, loa, amd pc,

[24/12, 3:19 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Don't judge the future. This is how we procrastinate and feel lazy. We try to judge it will be worthy or not the effort before the effort or result but only future can tell the effort was worthy or not the result. So, take a gamble. Take a risk. Do this. Only future holds the secrets.
[24/12, 3:23 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Momentums from past are holding you. You see future with the eyes of the past, you color future with the crayons of the past, but only future is something that is unknown. Even God doesn't know about future. Thats the beauty of it. Thats the spontaneity of it. Evolution itself doesn't know where it is headed, the whole thing is evolving, we are not evolving into something, bcoz for that there must be some set standard to get to evolved to. that is already evolved. No, everything is evolving. To what? No one knows
[24/12, 3:25 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): There is no god who know things more then you. The global consciousness (not media) is the collective god and it is heading into an unknown evolution. Don't be scared of this. We surely will not head to something bad offcourse bcoz evolution by the meaning of it's word itself only means that there will be a growth. Not destruction
[24/12, 3:25 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And destruction is what if not a way of growth itself
God is evolving too.
[24/12, 3:44 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): What powerful a god is who can't or don't want to evolve
[24/12, 3:44 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Just like parents evolve and grow with their kids, god is growing with us
[24/12, 3:45 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Universe is a dream dreaming itself
[24/12, 3:45 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And this dream is growing
[24/12, 3:45 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Getting intense day by day
[24/12, 3:46 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Y limit the whole to pronouns and personalities
[24/12, 3:47 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): ?? Just take my views with a grain of salt. The world is so magical, even physics laws are not constant through out the universe. How can my views hold.
[24/12, 3:48 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Universe is so inclusive that it can make all the theories about universe true
[24/12, 3:48 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Simultaneously
Future is interesting, so many things to learn, so many beleives to break, so many mistakes to make, so many
Negatively positively
Misconceptions n biases n beleives
Powers
So many things to get good in
Would you like it second time? Or with same intensity
Imagine you getting ideas on how to enjoy it more after enjoying it first time for second time
Imagine you getting interested or desire it after trying it
Try it, only then you'll get ideas on how to enjoy it

What will invoke desires/ideas/creativity in me
Powers
LD
Time
Wild imagination visualisation
The more Magical things you have in your life ,  the more you know the magicalness/value of the magicalness , and , so the more you want to get more Magical things in your life
Which desires
Saturday, January 14, 2017
11:24 PM
When you have powers and resources , you will automatically want to use powers and resources , and that automatically will bring ideas for which desires to fulfill.
Until then , copy other ppl desires , having them in list , thinking or contemplating about them ,or planning for them is futile and stupid and resultless
You should see what your current powers and resources are and how can you use them , this give you desires , out of those desires , some are benefits less and some help in powers , so choose 2nd type and do them
The more Magical things you have in your life ,  the more you know the magicalness/value of the magicalness , and , so the more you want to get more Magical things in your life
Future will never be at any point an orgasm. It will always be edging. It will be like a vanilla ice cream with cherries here and there. The time you'll come to next moment, you'll forget the fun in past moment. So, there is no collective point where you can say, woah. Bcoz all the fun is spreaded out and mind is incapable to keep exact record of all those happy moments in their true beauty and essence
Gambling is taking risks. Ex, take a risk to start pc if you don't want to..
These 30 years should not decide my rest of 50 years
How many things I don't know but I'm near to completion and may get results. Things may look boring n all but what if it is near completion and I'm dropping it at 99%. 
Wait for good days.. Time to time
What if that particular experience good
What if that Tea is of quality.
Future not only holds just the future but present and past too
You can only tell later the gamble was good or bad
You can't say it is worthy or not the effort before the effort or result.
Imagine if you haven't done those things which you have done. Like upgrading pc, or reducing 30 kg.
Imagine you still without it or still using alternative
Interesting gambles /experiments / projects for tomorrow
There is no limit of success. Even if world president or top billionaire, you may need details and intricacies, privacy, rich inner world, desires, ideas on how to enjoy and where to enjoy money, etc
Those , Who don't see meaning in life.. , Life is meaningless without powers
Bcoz you can't fulfill your desires without powers
With great powers comes great desires
This should be quoted
*With great powers comes great desires*
First get powers, life immediately will become meaningful
You'll get many desires
Many ideas
But not before
First, you need to get or increase your powers
After that, great desires will follow
Only a person worthy n capable of fulfilling n enjoy awesome dreams, gets the idea of them
Powers like law of attraction, money, time, relationships, health etc
You may not feel fun in fulfilling desires or you may not have much desires now bcoz you don't have powers right now, but when you do, you'll get lots of ideas for new desires, and you'll enjoy fulfilling your desires. Right now, it is a struggle. So, live for that
How will you manage a life where you have lots of desires and you can fulfill them easily but lots of desires
In which you also become easily good
See the desire which i couldn't fulfill or enjoy before having the amount of power (like in health) that i currently have
How many desires will it create
Can you feel these desires if you weren't thin
You didn't knew the desires the bike and being slim will create
Can i imagine the life now when I was 5 n at huda complex n near burma, evening..
I wouldn't be enjoying the life whatever it is I'm enjoying now if -
I haven't did keto, without dt, persist for home then huda, drop those friends,..
Other possible realities I might be in now instead of this - still in huda house, working in a stupid job, married to shubhangi,..
I've been cashing n milking that Chkpix effort so much
Future
What if in future, you find these -
What to live for, best zorba tech combined
Loa, luck
Powers, health, support,
Desires
*LIVE FOR A FUTURE BCOZ THERE WILL BE ONE DAY WHEN YOU'LL FEEL THAT YOUR WHOLE PAST PAID OFF, THAT NOTHING GO WASTED, EVERYTHING HAVE BEEN USED FOR WHERE YOU ARE NOW*
All the pain
All the hours wasted
All the turmoil
All the confusions
Everything
All paid
One day you'll found the role of your past in designing you
I used to have severe depression and i would have killed myself in past.. I tried multiple times too.. But something stopped me.. I was tired of all the mainstream bs religions and philosophies..  And today I'm having average of 5 synchronicities that are always very specific in nature, that specific that one can't cancel them as coincidence.. And i know, in future.. I will at some considerable position in the world.. This shit is no joke
The pain is like a stone being chiseled.. Not saying to invite it.. But it'll design you
I was tired of fat.. N the magical diet keto which is as powerful as loa helped me like fat is a joke
Anything is possible
If you are going through hell, keep going
If you don't feel excited for future, try techniques for the near future.. That is tomorrow.. (plan best tomorrow daily)
*if you struggle to find meaning and fun in your future, than stop that and instead try to plan your tomorrow everyday the best tomorrow.. Yes, not the future future but near future which is tomorrow*
Count the good things that will happen/or-I-do tomorrow (only tomorrow.. Not other days bcoz that greed will extend that to full future and so the tech will get diluted and impotent) -
What if all of your instant/immediate tomorrows holds awesomeness and a lot of fun things.. And you are excited for your immediate tomorrows every day. A life like that
Inspiration will come after the success
Motivation comes after success
That comes with little little success from the journey
Make sure the journey is rewarding in itself too
The learning
The choicefulness
The respect of your self instinct
Don't just focus on future.. Focus on present too
Don't just focus on present, focus on future too
Balance in both
Sometimes in ambitions, we forget our present happiness and sometimes in laziness we forget our future desires
We need balance
Fuck those monks who say just be in present
That's misguiding
Misleading
We need future too
Both is needed
Use knowledge and experience frompast, to work for a better future, while enjoying the journey and pizza (present)
Use knowledge and experience from *past*, to work for a better *future*, while enjoying the journey and pizza *present*
Daily do something for present, future
Maybe not tomorrow but next hour
So many new possibilities in this hour
Multitasking
Small-2 steps , we live by small small steps
Next hour
Make the next hour productive and fun both
One hour as productive n fun as possible
Multitasking
Random fun
That will/may happen or I do
Don't live in future or near future..just make the next hour awesome n productive etc
That.. You have so many options n choices in this moment technique
Health wealth principle
Use the hour fully..
As good as possible
Interesting things that I can do in next hour -
Tea (not all time)
Interesting pc tasks
Interesting thoughts n ideas
Reddit,..
Note - fun n productive
A future where I have interesting things lined up for next hour.. All time
-------------------- new me , alter egos
Help in politics but don't become a politician
Cook but don't become a cook
Earn money but don't become a worker or bread winner
Bcoz when you let yourself become anything, you limit yourself to one thing where you can become so many things. That's why, do all things, enjoy all things, but never let them consume you so much that they become your identity/you.
Imo jack of all trades is better than ace of one thing for he die enjoying the life in it's variety
Use randomness to enjoy everything .. Like usig those site randomiser set to open daily via eg to enjoy all sites
A future in which I'm more original
New you] Goal of life is to become more n more powerful everyday. Good thing is power is not just limited to body n health, so, don't worry about old age. Becoming more n more powerful can be a good hobby
Power is addictive
That point
Desires
Powers
Maybe that's why you feel good in nofap bcoz you are becoming powerful and in control
Disciplined
Choicefulness
Swag
Die powerful
Group the techs that will make me or feel powerful
Knowledge that you have power is very empowering in itself, not necessary to use it
Confidence,
It is liberating
That powers tech is this
Collect powers
It is incremental
I was mentally weak in past
Loa, ld
Porn makes us feel powerful. So many girls on fingertips. Thats why intriguing
Helpless
Power hungry
Search for quotes on power
Imagine yourself feeling powerful by that car or desire
Wild imagination
Evolution supports powerful

[23/12, 6:01 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Old age can't affect it
[23/12, 6:01 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Death will be beautiful with such knowledge that you were powerful till last second

[23/12, 6:02 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Add as many powers to you as possible
[23/12, 6:02 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Health wealth this that etc
[23/12, 6:02 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): So, if you get weak in one area, you still can find yourself powerful in all other areas
This tech is an all inclusive tech. It encompasses all other techs.
Power dynamics
Power surge
Loa n power
Loa is if not power
Power is a drug
Power is the only thing that can be maintained or increased in old age too (not just health)
The knowledge that you have power or that you are powerful is very empowering in itself
Power factor makes things lucrative and interesting. Use it to visualise for loa
Power factor, dominance
That wild visualising adds power factor too
Divide tasks that will make or add to my power

Automation
Computer will think for you
Delegation
Smart solutions
Increased smartness
Artificial intelligence
Less words
Neuralink
Less problems/desires
Minimalism
Have enjoyed most of desires , have solved most of problems
Imagine a future you so happy that he is thanking (loudly) the past you (the current you) for efforting and beleiving in a good future
Inversely, imagine a future you so sad that he is blaming (loudly) the.. For not..
Which future you you want, one who loves himself and you, or the one who hates himself and you. Effort on yourself and your life such that in future you'll become who love himself and you for efforting
If asked, would you become the you you were one month ago? No.. Right? So, why not you progress yourself to be months ahead
Experience, maturity
-------------------- 
Imagine a future where you don't have to be serious. Laughing n all. Untethered. 
There will still be these in future -
Bindu
Google
This generation of people
People I like
Things i like (not particular but inventions)
Trends I like
These good things that you like
Some things may end

========================
About tech :
Of course there are other easy ways to happiness but true spirit lies in this. This tech will add that spark in your life. This is the definition of alive.
Show them unusual things. Sometimes ppl hate unusual things
Loa helps in it
This way of finding for some cool tech is also an unusual thing and universe appreciate this uniqueness
It encompasses - cool tech, difficult tech, all techs, immersive,
Ppl will love this tech. And help each other in this
This tech includes memory tech
This tech puts you in present moment
My finding for some tech is also an unusual thing
Everything is unusual. Only amount differs. Have stamina to enjoy highly unusual things. Everybody enjoys unusual things but they are not that unusual. This is spirit
Create/enjoy highly unusual things. Do things unusually. In unusual ways, Enjoy the unusualness
Don't take it for granted, Enjoy the unusualness
Enjoy the unusualness
Unusual stuff - create, enjoy
Maybe does it mean negatively unusual too. Well negativity is usual
Unusual experiences
Difficult
Unusually difficult
Beneficial,..
Mauka,..
Feels like usual, not by time
To feel something unusual, unusual feeling
Mind too
Strive 4 highly unusual
It's getting too usual
Be highly unusual
Amount of unusual
Everything takes some time to be from unusual to usual
Some things never stop being unusual
Some things will never stop being unusual. They like always feel unusual
Somethings never stop being unusual or feel unusual
Seeing usual things unusually maybe
Maybe by using usual things
What about usual like sunning?  Well, it take some time to be usual.
Drop off usual things like fears, regrets, issues, ddy issues etc
Just ward of usual things and life will be unusual and also additionally add highly unusual things
Jobs which help in seeing unusual - reporter, photographer,
Show her unusual things, don't make her think of things usual to her. Or the things which are usual to her, try to make that unusual
The world/Society/system wants ppl to be usual, not unusual
This moment is pretty unusual from other moments
Moment to moment. Each moment is unusual
This moment is pretty unusual from other moments
Present moments
==============================
Unusual in these terms - unusual to you, unusual to society, unusual to you for some time,amount of difficulty,..
Where I am and all those things with which I interact with near n far -
Most interact - body , mind ,
Interact -
Less interact - people ,
Priority acc to most interact to less
++++
Physical Categories of Unusual things -
'- Abstract (digital etc too) n.. , physical or metaphysical, alive,
'- Nouns and verbs
'- Natural n manmade, by mine, personal,
'- beneficial in future , harmful, neutral
Different big areas of my life/i  -
Where I live, mentally and physically, near and far
And with whom I live there and
What I do, have, create there
What I have there and how I interact with those things there like create, modify, use etc
Levels of unusual :
Very near - mind , me
Near - body ,
Far - house ,
Very far - ppl ,
Fully my , my , not my
Maybe divide into usual and unusual
Time will auto add
Priority - 1) Ward off usual  2) unusual  3) highly unusual
Make sure the ways are unusual too
That "things to add" doc below this
==============================
Unusual w.r.t rest of the moments
Less usual than other usual moments/things
Maybe just improve all the areas of your life and live happy life
Maybe usual in case of interaction
Usual in my life -> detect and
- Ward off
- repair, modify, enhance
Now your life is surprising, now make it unusual (add unique new items)
Usual to lesser usual
Solutions - highly unusual maybe
Tech - new
It takes some time to get/feel old/usual
New W.r.t other moments, type etc

Money is a power that can immensely help in other powers - time, people, health,..
Free stuff is free
One approach is to create things by effort n enjoy, another approach is to buy things made by others efforts n enjoy. 
People put effort in things to sell them, so, they are good mostly, quality
Money can buy happiness indirectly by buying things which will give you happiness
To have multiple cool things is what humanity n evolution is, otherwise we are all animals having same life n same fun
Most good things are encroached n cashed, also all that which is cashed is good, it's easy to find quality things bcoz they sure are cashed

Just don't feel choiceless
Sunday, July 10, 2016
1:00 AM
(it will make you feel excited)
Suppose, you feel repressed/powerless/choiceless in the sense/case that you are tied to shop, hv to do/live-with shop things, tied to it, than.. Unrepress/reclaim yourself directly/indirectly
Directly - via solving or find balance, adjustments, solutions, mid ways, etc
Ex - If you have to adjust with veg foods, unrepressed via non veg or other ways,
If unfulfilable/difficult dreams, physics etc make you feel low - ld, vivid dreams,..
Indirectly - via beer, dynamic meditation , dance, (bcoz they provide/gives lots of choices), sometimes it is also called as escapism but it is not bad always.
Toys
Comfortable excitement
Maybe 2 sections - to not feel choiceless [unrepress yourself via..] ,  what-2 makes me feel choiceless
Create a list of docs of that section and sort
Sort by the amount of adjustance I have to do
Sort these by amount of choiceful they can make me feel, or choiceless they make me feel
Sort by amount
Sections - at home, at.. , at market
Idea - just simply don't get what you like, just solve what what you don't like and you will than love life as it is bcoz world is very interesting, it's just the.. Won't let you enjoy..
Once you get rid of or solve what what you don't like or can't enjoy , your life will become or feel like beautiful
Life will become interesting/exciting by itself, become or take ways/turn by itself
What what you cannot enjoy?
What what I like
I like almost everything but jote down what what I don't, What what I don't like that much or enough. Iykwim 
What you don't like about yo.. Bcoz it make you feel low /..
What you don't like
What what I don't like in this moment
Standby and now/these-days
Dislike
Don't like =/= hate
In future, what I don't like
What - 2 places my daily life consists of - my body , house , shop , market , my mind , everywhere
At home/shop/market/everywhere
Related to body(health)/digital/elec/..
What-2 i don’t like abt it
I don't like it but I also don't like it
Even if you don't like it, do it otherwise you have to face which you more don't like.
Addiction -  do it little time to time otherwise it will be worse when urges strikes by itself

List of low
Saturday, July 9, 2016
10:26 AM
List of things that are making me or can make me feel low in future
Like kids
Comfortable excitement
Choicelessness tech, contradictory situations, also ego etc
Y not list of what-2 I like
Why list of what what you don't like -  bcoz knowing and accepting that you don't like what you don't like is the first step towards change
Imp - No need of categorising, ex health,.. , Just see what is making me feel low ,and With time, the list and categorising [ex section - health] will increase . If u have ten digitalish type of names , than u have new category/group "digital" , groups and subgroups
I m actually ok as it is but just repressed 
I m ok as it is, naturally excited
Rest is greed
Enlightenment is a trap
Necessity is the mother of invention
I don't want to feel choiceless but it doesn't mean that I want to feel choiceful. Ways like dance and dynamic meditation etc are a way to not feel choiceless, not ways to feel choiceful.
Why not list of excitement - bcoz you naturally is.. But you need to solve.. Low.  Main thing is to feel excitement, how didn't matter.
Desires/likes originates from dislikes/needs. So,..
Otherwise desires/greed is unlimited, only dislikes defines true helping desires, rest is greed and gluttony.

Magical
Why Magical things aren't filling me
How to enjoy the magicalness
And To prolong , increase it
The more Magical things you have in your life ,  the more you know the magicalness/value of the magicalness , and , so the more you want to get more Magical things in your life
List of Magical things I have (not had) in my life ,or maybe which I m enjoying the magicalness of these days , not just have.
Magical effective dt , ideas , voice Typing , thinking , contemplation , using laptop for dt , etc
Levi jeans
That Magical room freshner
Magical Cleaning tricks
Magical arrangement of meds
Some cool episodes
porn
Weight reduction
Note - delete the content of this list once you stop enjoying that these days , move those to desires list if not already.
Note - writing magical with each item may make the magical word unmagical
Note - not to be greedy , but this list will show that you are enjoying life , and not not enjoying.
Maybe this is great type of Gratitude list
Magical is the way , not untolerables
How worse it would be if I didn't
Desire ?
slowly ,no jaldbaaji
Where is that memory technique. That have good memories
Motivation , demotivation , what will make me motivated afterwards
Approach - do tasks stepwise ,not all at once
I didn't do this task bcoz..
See Health good list
Doc - what stops me for doing something for a Desire , why I m delaying/procrastinating it
Note - sort them by most.. , also group the docs in time management section accordingly , also merge all Sections like time management , resistory beleives etc.
Because I am not pumped up enough
Because results aren't that permanent w.r.t effort
Because overall not good in that area , and all areas
Solution ,ex , med development log
bcoz So many things are wrong , Imperfect , lost , reversed
Because ego , have enough
Solution - poverty
Because not full knowledge
Because contradictory desires
Because boring , lazy
Because sad
Because risks
Bcoz no success in that area , for ex , if the desire is of area of health , than in the health area.
Because lack of powers and resources
Bcoz other steps too

Maybe sort by amount
No sorting by amount
Love is the driving force behind Loa
Loa - it will fulfill automatically if it is passion for you
Loa works when desire is strong and clear and desire is really a desire
Also things are complimentary, satisfaction brings satisfactions .There is no goal and way separated but only desires . Each desire also help each other. Iykwim. Maybe This is the real ideology behind loa.
Imagine the satisfaction and aid it will do for your general daily life wellbeing after doing it.
Convert "have-to" to desires
Convert goals to desires
Secret is to convert everything to a desire/passion. No step etc
Rewards and punishments
Best kind of motivation -
Desires which I can dream, which resonates with heart and passion, these are base of true Loa/love , which I want/like to fulfill ; not have-to fulfill for other target ,
Don't try to do a desire for another desire bcoz you than will lost the standalone motivations 4 it
Desire Is energy and motivation in itself. Convert everything to desires

What-2 is/can-be highly usual in my life and their solutions
Monday, February 22, 2016
12:57 AM
Usualness is bad , it doesn’t mean unusualness is good. Concept of unusualness is stupid
From usual , Just make it properly/fully unusual . There is no amount to unusual.
Upto level of that life becomes surprising , not expecting/usual
This tech is evolution in real terms . From usual to not usual [not to unusualness]
What abt usual that doesnt feel usual like sunning , well it aint that usual
Minutely unusual like moments
That which become unusual again
Maybe make your life highly unusual and u maybe win death
This tech is natural but easy to forget .kids knew this but forget/overwritten by bad education/schooling etc
Avoid those solutions which can get powerfully usual and hard to make unusual
Idiot is that who repeat the same mistakes
No repetition
This tech is like that no attachments (Buddhism) tech
What I do ,see ,create ,
How I do ,see ,..
Same thoughts
Ocd
Usual feelings ,problems
Slim and fat. Fat is more usual than slim. So avoid fat

Work on these mediums bcoz they help in enjoying life in diverse ways. They are like powers
Work on these current areas of your life (big time to small) (which are relevant)
Both two parts immersively ,Enjoy both 1 and 2 ,Both 1 & 2 are fun but 2 is more fun
1] which are not that much directly fun but help in that which are directly fun which is 2]

Efforts for..
Note - imagine it is illegal immoral banned expensive rare .. (see that quote)
Note - things that are easily available to you
Why this tech work - bcoz usually we are sad to not be able to do many things bcoz of various reasons,
this tech makes u feel doing and trying new and challenging things
There is a pleasure in doing such things
Sex is fun bcoz we haven't get to do it regularly and with different ppl
[28/02, 8:39 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): I get an idea from this quote.
Since anything that is illegal immoral fattening expensive impossible banned rare looks attractive to us and we live to get such things.. We want loa to use on these things..
Why not see things we have like those..
Like see tea as illegal
Reading harry potter as banned
Opening your favorite website as expensive
Etc etc
You get the gist
Trick is to make your everyday things feel like thing of those qualities mentioned in the quote
[28/02, 8:41 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): This is not an alternative to stop chasing things.. It is just parallel way to enjoy things you already have
[28/02, 8:41 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Just in spicy ways
[28/02, 8:43 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Be as if you aren't allowed to do those things
[28/02, 8:43 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Like say the f word
[28/02, 8:43 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): This tech will simulate emulate the feeling of liberation
[28/02, 8:44 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): We are already free.. But we forgot how the feeling of being free feels.. So, emulate that
[28/02, 8:44 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Emulate the feeling of liberation
[28/02, 8:44 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Don't go in New jails to get to free from.. Emulate the feeling
See Things you want to stop like bad habits etc as too easy or promoted or suggested by government.. Like see bed as promoted by Modi government

Life like a game
27-Jan-20
14:43
Gamify your life
Video Games are so addictive..
So, why not learn the strategies used in video games and apply them on your life
And make your life as interesting as video games
r/outside
What Makes a Game Addictive?
Reasons for Video Game Addiction
The High Score
Whether you’ve tried out the latest edition of Grand Theft Auto or haven’t played a video game since PacMan, the high score or completion percentage is one of the most easily recognizable hooks. Trying to beat the high score (even if the player is trying to beat his own score) can keep a player engrossed for hours.
Beating your Rival
More and more gamers are competing with or against friends and other players from across the world via the internet. There are many permutations of online competitive gaming. Some games involve forming clans to compete against other groups of players while others use the last man standing “battle royale” format, most famously Fortnite. Here the goal may be to rise up the leaderboard or to gain bragging rights over friends.
Ego
In addition Games, can “feed the ego”. When playing a game like Risk or Monopoly, conquering another person’s land or collecting a massive amount of rent is largely thrilling and satisfying. It is a tangible reward that shows your success in the game. Successful games are therefore a strong system of toil and reward and boost the player’s ego to the extent that he or she wants to keep playing in order to get that feeling. It’s especially notable that many kids who do not get rewarded or do not receive this sort of self esteem boost outside of the game world are the ones who will come back for more because it is in the game world that they get this type of satisfaction.
Beating the Game
This “hook” isn’t used in online role-playing games but is found in nearly every gaming system. The desire to beat the game is fed as a player “levels up,” or finds the next hidden clue.
Teenage boys, in particular, are motivated to play for hours on end in order to get to the higher levels of the game, where they can earn better armor, equipment, and WOW gold. 
----------
Relationships
Again, this is primarily an online “hook.” Online role-playing games allow people to build relationships with other players. For some kids, this online community becomes the place where they’re most accepted, which draws them back again and again.
Community
Particularly in reference to video games, online communities formed by Role Playing Games (RPGs) such as the World of Warcraft or Runescape provide valuable communities for their players. Online games give anyone the opportunity to forge new identities and engage in activities in imaginary lands that will not judge them like the real world would.
Addictive video games feed a need of making social connections. While video games used to be solitary activities, today's games encourage, and in many ways, require that players interact socially with each other - which feeds the universal human need for interpersonal connections. Interestingly, these connections can come at the expense of real-world relationships.
The more addictive video games often encourage play and collaboration with gamers worldwide. This is true of online multiplayer video games in general. The fact that two users on opposite sides of the world can interact and join together in a common quest adds to the excitement and exploratory nature of modern games.
Addictive video games often require team play to advance. A player starting a new game will initially be able accomplish goals by him/herself. However, before long significant advancement in the game requires that he/she join a group and accomplish goals together. The player will come to feel a connection to the team and responsible for advancing their gaming goals. Therefore, the player will want to advance his character even more so that he can make a greater contribution to the team. In fact, if he does not keep up with his team he may not even be able to join in on certain quests or travel to parts of the world requiring a more advanced character. Finally, since many tasks can only be accomplished in a group, the player will be want to be online whenever his teammates are playing (which translates into more total hours online). The team component is clearly a very important factor in why certain video games are addictive.

Role-Playing
Role-playing games allow players to do more than just play – they get to actually create the characters in the game and embark on an adventure that’s somewhat unique to that character. Consequently, there’s an emotional attachment to the character, and the story makes it much harder to stop playing.
Addictive video games may allow the player to immerse him/herself in a fully realized virtual world. You can create your own character with attributes you wish you had in real life. You form relationships, develop a career, and accomplish things that would be impossible (or require far more effort) in the real world. Video games may offer an escape from the reality of the physical world and into a digital universe where players can assume any identity they desire.
it’s like starring in your own movie.
A new self instead of old boring character
Skill
Games that are successful, or in other words, games that are addictive have other equally intriguing qualities. Many games build up levels of complexity. The players acquire novel skills that they must apply to other situations in the game. Upon learning these skills, the game becomes even more complex, causing the player to want to complete increasingly difficult challenges, effectively hooking them onto the game. Professor of Computer Science, Maria Klavee offers some insight into this and says that video games, in particular, “offer some real opportunities for puzzle solving, strategic and critical thinking.”
Video games are more addictive when in-game rewards are based on a leveling system. When starting a new video game a player's character begins with very basic attributes with regard to experience, strength, intelligence, courage, powers, etc. Initially, it takes very little play (perhaps minutes) to reach the next level and gain new skills - this is immediately rewarding and reinforces continued play. However, each successive level begins to take more play time to reach - eventually taking weeks or months to level-up. By this time however, the gamer has gradually adapted and accepted the greater effort required to reach the next level. Imagine if the very first levels (e.g., from Level 1 to Level 2) took 1 month rather than several minutes - how many players would find this rewarding enough to continue?
Press start…to make friends, to be in charge. Press start…to escape. Press start, because really, do you even have a choice?
It begins of course with an introduction to a new world, where success is not about age or experience; you are in complete control. There is constant stimuli – and immediate pay-offs.
Discovery
The exploration or discovery tactic is most often used in role-playing games. One of the most popular online games of all time is World of Warcraft, and a good portion of the game is spent exploring imaginary worlds. This thrill of discovery (even of places that don’t really exist) can be extremely compelling.
The virtual world of addictive video games continues to evolve even if the player is not online. Therefore, if you are not playing and active in the developments of the world, you are potentially left behind when you rejoin. To avoid "missing" something you must play as much as possible.
Companies regularly release upgrades or expansion packs. Even if players start to get bored of the online worlds their characters inhabit, video game expansion packs can always add new areas for exploration, new abilities to try, new tasks to complete, and new characters to develop.
The most addictive video games have no pre-defined ends. This is one of the central features of a MMORPG, but it is also becoming true for many other genres as well. The most addictive video games have no ultimate goal or point at which a player can say "I'm finished. I have completed every quest - there is nothing new to discover". As such, there is never the experience of "Game Over" - a point which signifies the natural end to a game.
vast alternative reality offered by these games.
In blog after blog, gamers said the addictive nature of these games comes not just from the variety of gameplay, but from the ever-changing nature of the game. There is no “winning” the game and therefore no definitive end. There is no ultimate goal.
Reaching the highest level in the game requires hundreds of hours of playing time, and right when a certain character level has reached its max, the game changes! Many players use multiple characters, trying on different roles and weapons.
What differentiated this type of console game from the others is that there is an end to the game. At some point, after many, many hours of play, the gamer does reach a final level. But in the multiplayer, online mode, the variations are endless and many went back, again and again, to the hook of enjoying the popular first-person shooter format.
----------
Video games can generate strong emotions in players. Because the world and the online experience is mostly user generated, gamers can experience wars, betrayal, friendship, romance, marriages, funerals, etc. The variety and intensity of emotions experienced online can be similar to emotions experienced in the real world.
Novelty
Rewards
Challenges
Gambling
You know that with enough tries , you can win it
You know that others are playing it too and they are winning it too with strategy etc
Games that hook players are often designed to be just difficult enough to be truly challenging, while allowing players to achieve small accomplishments that compel them to keep playing. In that respect, the design of video games is similar to the design of gambling casinos, which will allow players to have small “wins” that keep them playing.
Side-quests or multiple missions at a time , choose any mission or do missions simultaneously . This is like multitasking
One important factor that makes video games addictive is that rewards often are set on variable schedules.  It has been consistently demonstrated in psychological research that variable ratio (reinforced after an average number of attempts) or variable interval schedules (reinforced after an average time period has elapsed) produces a steady rate of responding and which is far more difficult to extinguish (e.g., slot machines use variable ratio schedules to encourage maximum play time). In an addictive video game, a player may be rewarded on average for every five (for example) tasks completed. Sometimes it will take only one try while other times it may take 15 - the player never really knows how long it will take before the big reward comes - but he knows that if he plays long enough it will come eventually. This type of reward schedule encourages longer periods of play even in the absence of rewards. For a more detailed analysis of the ways people respond to different patterns of in-game rewards, see the article Behavioral Game Design.
Top video game players or teams can earn real world rewards (e.g., tournaments for cash prizes). This can be extremely motivating and can encourage massive amounts of time to hone and develop skills (the equivalent of an athlete training for the Olympics).
Addictive video games do not reward short and unscheduled periods of play. Games that are very addictive require long-term commitments (months or years) of regular gaming sessions lasting at least an hour or more. MMOs, real time strategy games, and many first person shooters appeal to the hard core gamer who invests a significant portion of his free time to the experience. Due to the great investment (e.g., months developing a character) it becomes very hard to "throw away" all the work and uninstall the game.
You know there certainly is rewards
It triggers cravings and compulsions and changes the structure of the reward system until it mirrors the mechanism as seen in the brains of those with other addictive disorders.
Dr Jihene explains: “Even if a player fails in a game, the reward centre, which is the dopamine centre, is still stimulated – it’s correlated with deliberation time in beating risk taking. So they [gamers who are addicted] will continue to take risks. It will be very easy taking the decision to take a risk, because the centre of the stimulation will be stimulated all the time.” This risk-taking behaviour breeches real-reel life boundaries. ”There is continuous seeking of dopamine reward for the brain.”
Addictive video games often have some form of in-game currency. The same goals and emotions which drive people to pursue wealth in the real world are also present in video games. As one amasses more virtual wealth (by spending more time playing and completing tasks), the virtual wealth translates into greater power, control, respect, influence, status, and purchasing power - which are obviously very seductive pursuits.
Some video games require monthly fees. In order to play gamers must pay $15 - $20 per month even after the game has been purchased. Of course, the fact that there is a regular monthly charge encourages users to play more so that they "get their money's worth".
It is easier to view video games as harmless online activities. Whereas there is far greater awareness of the dangers of alcohol abuse or gambling addiction, online gaming is generally seen as harmless hobby. Is it less harmful than alcohol addiction? Absolutely. Can most people play without becoming addicted? Sure. However, because of this it is also more difficult for players to recognize when they have a problem.
¦  Technology aid: She adds that it will help children be introduced to the technology; improve reaction time; improve creativity and imagination.
¦  Dreams and wishes: The kids can realise all their fantasies which will give them some satisfaction and self-esteem, especially with kids who are shy.
¦  It will improve the eye-hand coordination. It will help to enhance focusing process – we can focus on many factors at the same time without confusing them.
Playing games involves repeated actions that spark connections related to memory and learning. Dr Jihene explains that it also stimulates the premotor and parietal cortex area in the brain - sensory movements in games that require real-time action - and the prefrontal lobe, which controls decision-making. Also stimulated is the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex that controls cognition and running.
It’s basically hijacking these areas of thought.
¦  Cognitive benefits: Meanwhile, Dr Lkorchy says, “Some research showed some cognitive benefits to gaming such as improvement in memory, perception, attention, and decision making.”

This game has something for every type of player – fantasy, fighting, playing together, or playing alone.
play anywhere, including at work or in school.
fun and unpredictable nature of pitting your skills against other gamers and communicating in real-time with rivals through specialist headsets.
Therefore the simplest formula to making an addictive game is to make it challenging, interesting, and rewarding. Any game can elicit a feel-good sensation for a short amount of time, but the games that can accurately be called addictive, though different for everyone, are those that you routinely go back to that keep you feeling good all the time!
Pavlov’s conditioning technique– a repeated response to a particular stimuli – we are all already trained to like to play, to learn. Why then should a medium that wraps you in tentacles of knowledge and power (at least online) be any different?

Which Games Are Most Addictive?
Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) can be especially addictive because there’s no “ending” in a classical sense. Unlike old-fashioned games like Super Mario Brothers, where you win when you save the princess, you can’t rescue the princess in an MMORPG.
Indeed, even in online games that produce a clear victor by the end, it need only be a matter of seconds until the player joins the next game. Because each game presents a new challenge and new opponents, boredom is unlikely to set in as quickly as it would if you simply repeated the same scripted levels over and over.
Why are video games addictive and why do MMORPGs / MMOs seem to be especially addictive?
What is a MMORPG / MMO? In MMO games, players typically create their own character(s), join other players online to form committed teams (clans, guilds), and develop their character's skills, powers, and abilities by completing certain tasks or quests in a fantasy world which is largely shaped by the players. The worlds continue to evolve even when the player is offline.
Types of games
Massively Multiplayer Online: Step one, enter virtual game room. Step two, engage with players from around the world on the platform of your choice - personal computer, video game console, smartphones, etc. World of Warcraft is one such game.
Simulations: Want to learn how to fly a plane or how it feels to be an astronaut in space? This is the one for you! You experience simulations of real-world vehicles and learn how to control them.
Adventure: Ok, so you get a backstory and a mission. And it’s up to you to save lives – or just complete your tasks. If teams are not your thing, choose one of these.
Real-Time Strategy: Welcome to the battlefield where strategy can mean winning a war or dying a painful death. Usually, you’d gather items and armies, form alliances and allegiances.
Puzzle: Riddle me this – who likes to solve mysteries? Whether you like simple or complex zigsaws, these are games to get that grey matter working.
Action: Quick reflexes, check. Self-starter, check. This is the one you want. Use your wits and skills to get your avatar into the winners’ circle.
Stealth shooter: Eye spy with my little eye – kaboom. That’s right, as the name suggests you are in a war zone or spying and stealth is one of your weapons.
Combat: Get over here. One-on-one fights – choose your character and use their powers to defeat your enemies – think Mortal Kombat.
First Person Shooters: You see the field through your character’s eyes.
Sports: World Cup fans, here’s something to keep you hooked: there’s a Fifa game. But you can choose other sport too including baseball, basketball and more. Just don’t feel tricked into thinking you are getting exercise.
Role-Playing: Would you like elfish ears to go with that magic sword? In a role-playing game, you pick your part in a narrative and play along.
Educational:  Or educative, this games combine subjects like math and logic with quizzes to entertain as they teach.

[08/04, 2:10 PM] +91 6370 645 539: Hlw any switched word to make own interest on everything?
I want to generate interest within me to do or enjoy anything as I have feelings tht am losing interest from everything which make me sometimes upset for no reason even I know I have talents but couldn't find urge to do. ??
Besides switchwords, let me tell you another method that help me
It's not wrong to be numb about some things bcoz it's evolutionary.. If you keep finding passion in regular ordinary things.. You'll stop exploring for other cool things..
So, stop enjoying average ideas, and, look for big cool ideas in everything, and you'll, find that you are now passionate about it
If I had kept enjoying the mainstream religions, I would never came across law of attraction and things like switchwords.. They seem like big cool ideas once, and they than sparked interest in me
And now, from simple law of attraction, I am exploring synchronicities now, they are big cool ideas for me now
Right I am like could not be passionate from my passion
Look for BIG ideas
Ignore average ideas
And don't force yourself to be
Don't try to enjoy small things in life
Bcoz you'll be stagnant in life than
Find big ideas
Find big ideas in ordinary things
Tell me something that you were interested in before but not now
One example
Ok.. In movies, find big cool ideas.. Like try Korean movies, or watch movies of actors with same mbti personality like you
That will be the next BIG idea for you in movies
Ideas are cool
But not average ideas are cool
Find BIG ideas
When you push enough, you'll find atleast 2-5 big ideas in everything, every field
And they will spark the passion
Like electricity is some big fookin idea for Nikola tesla
And like e=mc2 is some big idea for einstein
Tell me the field you want to create interest/passion in
I'll help you find some big ideas in it
Like In writing, there can be some really cool BIG ideas, that are different from traditional ideas
Like, you can use neuralink to write in future if , or grammarly app that can automatically repair your tense and Grammer structure, etc etc
Bigness in big ideas are subjective
Etc
U get the gist I hope
Like stickers was next big thing in WhatsApp
Or Steve jobs demonstrating scrolling feature first time in mobiles via first apple mobile
Big ideas
And not small ones
Don't look at small ideas.. They will waste your passion
And you'll end up seeing everything as average bcoz of them
This group can be next big idea for you
To dicuss python
Some big ideas to learn python -
- reverse engineer scripts to understand
- create scripts in eventghost and automate your pc and house
- start learning artificial intelligence
Etc
Some big ideas
And not average
But bigness in big ideas is subjective
Ain't they look like some next level big ideas?
Something that can spark your passion
Like mouth watering ideas
And big ideas feels big when you yourself searched for them
Not when someone tell you, bcoz than you'll not feel them as personal and you are not that invested in them
Like Ted talks.. They seem so interesting bcoz most of them discuss some big invention, some next level big idea or concept or technology. Thats why they are ahead of so many interesting youtube channels bcoz the level of their ideas are big
Don't compare yourself with their success.. Find your own big ideas and success..
Passion is success
Once you start getting /finding big ideas in that field, universe will help you getting it fulfilled bcoz of law of attraction
Law of attraction follows passion
Jab kisi chiz ko shiddat se chaho toh puri kay at tumhe ussey milane me lag jaati hai
Kaynaat*
In English, once you love a thing fully, whole universe start pulling it to you
Next level big ideas for you -
- start from tiktok.. (unprofessional, small etc).. It will open you up
- start promoting your channel on insta via popular tags
Etc
Try think of cool BIG ideas
Whatever interests you, whatever your heart feels interesting, you'll see related synchronicities
This is universe bringing it to you
Like you interested in some actor, you'll start to see that actor more
Like you thinking about some word, that interests you
You'll see that word written here and there
Passion is the key to law of attraction
And big ideas constitutes passion
big ideas makes dopamine boost/spikes too
if a idea/task is boring , just add it up to some other idea/task that is big
Big ideas tech will help in Loa too by making things interesting
Make every ordinary task interesting by applying some fun tweak to it 5 second crafts style (youtube Channel) to make it look like some big idea
Ikagai. Repairing things with big ideas .. Using big ideas
See if you can find a big idea for each task or idea, associate etc
There is no fun in trying to enjoy small ideas and it shunts the growth and evolution. Big ideas is the way
Bcoz of greed, I tried to saw all ideas as big
To motivate yourself to do tasks and chores, associate them to big ideas or find or create some big ideas in them
Big idea - Use text finding apps to find the content with word "synchronicity" in all the books in pc
Big ideas.., don't try to enjoy small ideas. Numbness is good bcoz it ensures finding more new ideas bcoz you get tired of averageness and mediocrity
Imagine a life where you get to fulfill 5 big ideas everyday
Girl - 3 hr , times full satisfaction - 10 ,
Park - 1 hr , 5
Girl - 3 hr , times satisfaction - 10 ,
Binges of not thing but full satisfaction

Slow time
Again and again

This is present moment tech
Immerse , immersion
No hurry , nothing else is tempting
First imagine yourself doing it in hurry , that very low time to enjoy it , then imagine enjoying it slowly

Hooker , 1 hr , Full night

Types of areas - physical, metaphysical, social n me
Like a meditation , mindfulness
Immersively create/enjoy/enhance immersive [actions , things , people , issues , thoughts , lifestyles ,..]
====================== =
Y immersion 
divide by goals of immersion -
Sort types by priority
P1] survival helping ,useful , no addictions or repair or recreational ,
P2] answers/truths , meaning , liberation ,
P3] Time/life pass , fun (cool , difficult/challenging , unique , new) ,
Bcoz :
bcoz if u didn't deliberately immerse in nice things , you/your-energy will be automatically immersed in not so nice things. Like laziness etc. And you will then not see meaning in life , become depressed etc.
If u are truly freely deliberately immersed , you will become a witness of yourself and it is very liberating.
Bcoz if immerse in some spiritual things like meditation , it might give you some deep quenching answers for life questions like death etc.
This is the best meaning/purpose of existence/life till now
Vibrations and immersion :
No doubt that vibrations is the language of loa but know that immersion in the desire will create or increase the vibrations.
I will or am experience it bcoz.. vibrations
You attract what you are. That Reddit top post.
And i am what I am immersed in. Bcoz I too am vibration and immersing in that vibration make me that vibration.
Words or thoughts cannot raise vibrations.
In what you can fully/deeply/subconsciously immersed , you can attract.
If u are fully/deeply/subconsciously immersed in it , you will attract it.
When you are fully immersed in it , you emit it's vibrations and those attract similar vibrations
====================== =
Immersion/how to immerse in it
How to immerse - 
Slowly, via dt, spend time,
Exact reverse of how to fight urges - set reminders and the triggers , concentration , do it daily , see profits ,
Curiosity
Immerse your what - nofap energies , intelligence , time , yourself , creativity , body ,
curiosity , why I want it , what I want from it .. , what will it make me feel ,Etc etc
That's how meditation works
Words can only help in mental , but what about emotions ,.. Etc etc
Immerse in it mentally/logically/emotionally/spiritually/physically/deeply/subconsciously..Etc etc and thus you become it and you attract what you are. Maybe not right that but related to it or helpful to it like ideas , opportunities , inspirations etc etc.
See it as so easy that already done (experiment of conformity)
Spend time. Don't mix with other desires. Dedicate whole day/week only to it.
Profits-loss
- thankingly imaginary feel how having that feel overally and to all senses etc In detail. Benefits.
- be as if u were clear that why you wanted it , what you wanted from/about it ,To experience what, what curiosity , etc.
- be as if you've Used DT , vision board , effort etc and in that way ,be as if it was possible bcoz .. Me/universe/desire/life/.. Is..
-be as if you are living like that
- bcoz i was curious about the result of the combination of ..
- bcoz the visuals of it is clear in my mind
- bcoz my life is all about it
- bcoz I am that which she love , and is interested in
- 'I am' / life etc is very deep in subconscious , so use it by associating to immerse. Similarly visuals , curiosity , emotions , senses , words ( not that deep) , another gratitude item for which the gratitude is deep ; use that , sleep time , deep beleives , time , memories , third eye meditation, dreams/LD , meditation ,
Maybe just getting close to subconscious is enough , my desires will get automatically realized and fulfilled , no need to immerse.
Immersion = subconscious
Use that in which you are already and deeply immersed lovingly or unwantingly to your advantage in immersing in what you want to immerse.
Also immerse in the memories of each word of the desired sentence.
Find all that in which I am immersed and use that to immerse in what I want to immerse.

De-immersion
Why not immersion -
bcoz it takes time and resources to immerse in something , its not that easy
bcoz I cannot get into immersion all by myself (needed loa help) ,
addictions 
bcoz it is difficult to get out of immersion in case of some things ,
Too much immersive becomes addictions and addictions won't let you enjoy other immersive things and you will in future regret variety in immersive experiences missing. I was so uncontrollably into addictions and I was thinking it as natural. living like animals and proud. Cannot see my mistakes bcoz of ego and ignorance
Momentum of addiction
Diverting by immersion in other things..
Healthy immersions - not contradictory but compatible , affordable , not temporary , controllable ,
Some addictions -
Contemplation ,overthinking ,eating ,DT ,computing , mobiling ,Emily ,rechecking/ocd ,
Immersed in issues like death , fears ,past , regrets , tensions etc
Emotional baggage
Immersed in thoughts
-------------- need for deimmersion --------------
Why can't I attract it or fully immersed in it ? Bcoz me/my-energy/subconscious-energy-powers is already immersed-in/limited-by other immersions like painbody etc. Reclaim yourself from that.
Tackling limiting vibrations
Not negative , but limiting
Limiting in case of immersion in other
Maybe -
Your current desires stems out of negative vibrations. Tackle those negative vibrations and you will have good desires and they can be fulfill easily. From negative equivalent.
How to find from what to deimmerse from ?

Synchronicities , confirmities , signs

You unknowingly beleive in have to some job
Heart shattered. Lol
Why loa - Life is hard without loa and just by my self. With loa , it is dreamy
Impossible ,illogical will happen as next logical step
That Reddit top post
Emotional guidance system emotions
Do all that which the universe tell you to do for it.
Effort , dt , memory , visualisation, research, third eye meditation, helps in immersion
This tech let me examine each thoughts of targeted desire easily like meditation/mindfulness
That's why it manifested late in their life , bcoz it took time to actually deeply immersed in it. Atleast in their cases.
Things) try
I want to experience these "in detail" -
Nepal,..
Maybe create list of experiences I experienced in detail.. It doesn't matter what experiences, matters what is how many
Experiences I'm experiencing in detail these days -  
Things i feel i might experience first time in this year (by naturally or by efforts of my regular old /new habits /interests) -  deliberate synchronicity, updated pc (multitasking power), local gf,  new sx,
Note - bcoz i dont care about repeat fun moments bcoz fun is not what we should be after for it is boring. But the newness.
Create list of things that you've experienced first time this year
Kids also love the things they get to see first time.. They have high curiosity for first time things
First time in life or first time in six months /years
How to enjoy repetitive things as first time
Things i saw for first time recently -
Little car accident outside sector home
Can't wait to "try" these - stylus,  new updated pc, another slut, 
?? Can't wait to try those results
Only results, not progress or efforts etc
Maybe - Try the shit out of the results
Can't wait to try out those results
Can't wait to try those results out
I don't know whether I'll like the results or not
Can't wait to give a try to the results
Maybe - try it for the results and to see how much you will like /enjoy it
Can't wait to try of these types - new ideas n strategies n technologies,
Can't wait to try those ways
So many of these to try -  things (books, furniture,..), people, digital things, places, ideas, techniques,..
Can't wait to try - those..
Life long desires - can't wait to try
Try it for the wonderful results it is supposed to give
Can't wait to try it to check the hype
Try it for long term results, or butterfly effect
Try to find out what it is.. Is it what it is..
Try for experiments with results, or cocktail etc
Maybe - try it for fun, possibilities,..
Add those experiment meta techs to it
Curiosity
Y this tech - bcoz, no expectations of only good and best, and you ready for bad experiences too
Scientific experimentative spirit
It also saves you from procrastinating how the result would be bcoz it implies that you just don't know bcoz you haven't tried it yet
Future will feel fresh
You will not take anything as certain, but like trying
This tech stops you from ruining the fun of it by not letting you guess, imagine or analyze or compare it
All techs looks good bcoz you can't wait to try them out n they all suck when there is nothing to try in them left
That's why techniques etc look interesting too and once you tried them, they don't. Main thing is the element of "try"
It will make you try real girls bcoz you've tried porn enough
Childlike curiosity
Ras
It kills the ego and unworthy.. Etc too bcoz now you pursuing things to try them rather then intention to gluttony or greed or store them
It will make you active and positively decisive
It makes your biases unaffective
Loa will work too
It will make you leave old
"Can't wait to try it out" is way way more believable then you visualising yourself enjoying it. Bcoz you don't really know that you will be able to enjoy it or not, or enjoy that much, etc. Also when you visualise yourself enjoying it, you killed that desire bcoz you already enjoyed it. Whereas.. "can't wait to try it out" always keeps the mystery and interest in desire intact
A try also feels good bcoz it can go way way more good then what you can imagine or anticipate in a visualisation. There is that hidden probability in that which is difficult to think of when visualise.
Visualisations etc always killed the curiosity in the desire.
When you visualise a desire, it get plagued with your current sadness and boring life and problems.  But when you see a desire as untried and untested, you don't want to think about it but to get to it asap to try it.., you get highly and continously motivated
Visualisation is seeing something which can have unlimited possibilities in a limited way, whereas, "can't wait to try it" respects that unlimited possibilities factor
Before loa/visualising - I want that
With loa - visualising
Without visualising - can't wait to try it
Genuine interest is the only thing required for loa, and visualisation kills that,
Maybe - if you still want to visualise, you can visualise, a situation giving you more and more things to try. Ex, a car situation that you want to try which is giving you more n more things to try
When you visualise it, you tried it. So, there is nothing left to try. And that's why no interest and fun left.
Maybe - don't visualise it long enough that you don't want to try it anymore, visualise it maybe long enough that you want to try it
It will make you think out of the box
How to do regular things then
Maybe - You don't care if you later found that it is meh.. Atleast you tried it and you enjoyed the trying of it.  Move onto next.
You may find that it is not worth it, or dissappointing, or shallow, or meh but..
Like the multiple choices when loving a girl...like can't wait to try kiss her, can't wait to try slap her ass, etc.. Try for that she like or not.. And feel hot or not..
Let's give it a try
Try it for..
What if I've tried that or gave it a try
Can't wait to try new things
Start
Trial
Can't wait to try yourself out with it
Can't wait to try for it
Be as if you've never even tried it before
Try new things
Can't wait to try the shit out of it
Try the results with it
Try it with it
Try the trying for it
Try it for such results
Try it for the results
Try the concept
Can't wait to try to see how it feels
?? Can't wait to try/judge it face to face instead of in mind. I'll judge it face to face instead of before. I'll only judge it when I m trying it. 
Can't wait to try it by my hand
Can't wait to find things about it
Can't wait to explore it
Can't wait to try it for first time
Can't wait to find more n more uses of it
Can't wait to use it as a step
Be happy that there is so much to try in it
Can't wait to try it's potential,.. The potential in it
Can't wait to be good in it
Can't wait to try yourself in it, to check your potential in it
Can't wait to try it when you've become good in it
Can't wait to try it in it. Can't wait to try that in something that I like
Can't wait to find out how much good i can be in it
Can't wait to see how much I'm already good in it
Can't wait to get new achievements in it
Can't wait to start new achievements groups
Can't wait to try that/those idea/s/resources in that
Can't wait to try it that way
try everything, esp all that which i haven't try before, 
You can't forget in your lifetime that you have tried it or not.. N thats the legacy..  That you have tried it or not, n how was it, basic experience , etc
High zeal for that
Can't wait
Strive for a life in which you have tried everything or as many as possible things
Excitement is that there are so many things I haven't tried yet
Create log of how many untried (by me) things I tried today
Is the ways also come in untried
Is this the log of things I see first time today
The try tech make you excited for each day
Tried untried in something tried.. Category kinda
Also maybe categorise your tried, by awesomeness
Strive for a future in which you can daily try new things
Desire for untried make you do all regular things consistently and continuously bcoz you don't want to get pulled by the regular things
Examples to get - updated pc,
Fixed targets and random
Don't write here old or tried things even if you have tried them a long time ago and not since then and they are cool bcoz then you'll not feel motivated for new and untried things
Made my day
New /first-time things I tried /saw today -
Try Anything, anything new and untried

Ways to happiness - body 
--------------------------------------------------------- -
Visible external senses/mediums ,Invisible senses/mediums ,Internal body parts
And their combinations too
Overall :
cozy ,comfort ,other health , health , sleep ,pain, balance, vibration, internal ,Cleanliness, hygiene ,breathe, weight (lightness) ,Posture
chakras maybe, Maybe soul (Untethered)
Bodily fluids ,blood, harmones ,chemicals ,Body chemistry
Skin/touch ,touch ,Temperature, skin ,Skin (touch, bath, kiss etc) ,Sensitivity 
Energy/kinetic/strength , different energies , Core strength,Bones,whole body (dancing, etc) 
physique ,
style ,
Beauty
Aura
Head :
Eyes ,voice ,Ears, nose, taste,
Head , Memories ,intelligence/mind/soul/consciousness
Throat (voice, singing)
Mid :
Heart-area/chest/Heartbeat , stomach
Fire in you, your heart
Bottom :
sexual
Emissioning (urine, gas, shit, sneeze etc)
Throat + stomach (laughing)
Note - initial body doors , not secondary 
I just basically want to feel happy/cozy etc but how I feel happy ? Bcoz of the feel good chemicals [that’s how drugs work too] so.they
Feel good chemicals exist in body and to release them , do any .. Thing which somehow belongs/related to body. stimulate body parts via body parts via things . You can see all that which can makes u happy is directly-indirectly related to body
But y not just one solution ? - problems in other parts of body won't let me enjoy happiness from other parts. Also sometimes you get tired of one , desensitization, tored out
Stimulate that body part or combinations using things etc to feel good
Two ways of solving it in your body - directly, indirectly. Iykwim
directly (via body) or indirectly.
If you want to feel good - direct and indirect ways to release those feel good chemicals in body
Risks also give big opportunity.
Whatever you do, make your body cozy and feel/immerse-in that coziness
All the ways which had/is/can/will make you happy/sad somehow relates to body. So..
Immersive through body
Solutions to my mental problems, depression, lack of happiness and content and harmony etc are in my body, that's how some life changing drugs work like ahusasca, dmt etc.just By changing body chemistry
Don’t create structure in folder but here , divide by priority like + ,++ ,+++ , divide by straight and vague solutions , only big docs to word
Its true that feel good chemicals are in body but not the areas which .. , I can read body to detect more areas though
== > Just stay fully motivated/pumped-up/confident/charged/energized/light/hopeful/desire-4-life/dreamish everytime, it helps to live life. Solve the reasons which doesn't let you motivated. And maybe this is loa too and make you feel alive
Problems :
If body ain't happy, than you ain't whatever you do . No happiness feels happy if there is a problem with body, pain etc
Things bad for body - anger, desensitization,
Solve painbody, emotions, regrets effects on body parts
Find reasons why that body part is not happy maybe
Deattachment from body
Imp -  Things like goobi marriage, until it didn't happened good, body is at pain like mind bcoz that body part is associated with that. So, dont let such association create in first place
Y i m not/can't feeling cozy
If you are feeling sad -
Find the reason, find the body part which .. , solve..,
Its connection with body is what creates real attachment and solving that is one big way to get rid of attachment
Maybe :
Trust and belonging: oxytocin 
Euphoria and determination: endorphin [pain]
Motivation: dopamine
Safety and respect: Serotonin
W.r.t body n..
Seeing it witnessingly means..
Body releases feel good chemicals when it feels [through body parts below..] something new , dangerous maybe, difficult , evolution ,immersive
That’s how watching porn , playing games , ld etc work as simulations to real thing
be happy that atleast i have the right tech
Rename Excuses doc to motivation
Enzymes, bacterias
Body needs sperm for this tech
Google more body parts ,Meditation body scan , body each part
Let body be the center of all dt Mindmapping model
About tech :
You were happy in childhood bcoz you are very connected to rest of the body, not just mind . All other animals and kids are just naturally close to body and thus happy and contented .This is what it means that happiness comes from within
Which religions, cultures, nations, etc are spreading this imbalance between mind and body - east, buddhism,
Body is the medium of divine and I will fulfill all that which it feels the need to fulfill , Body is the temple ,Flute of god ,That quote about body (what what it can do) ,I m body, body is temple ,Idk before or after body about happiness etc, but while body, body is the medium  ,Body is that which connects and is a medium to everything
This is loa too ,Maybe this tech is to live in present ,to make you feel alive , be natural ,Zorba tech. This tech makes you comfortable and confidant ,This tech will build your character
Loa - associate dreams in context of body . Like car and body
Fun things today(remaining)/tomorrow/weekend/near-future that are coming  -
Standby [bcoz maybe bcoz regulars]
--
Number of things - 8
Things not in future bcoz they are not promised
Only tomorrow n not..
Urge to add things which you most probably not gonna do
Honest
Fun things you are going to do n not going to do for the tech
Not the day after tomorrow or after
Maybe if morning, then.. Today
Not fun of future but of latest future which is of tomorrow
Later also add things which weren't known already but did or happened anyway
Which i forgot to write
Enjoy the unguessed things as bonus , enjoy the guessed things as preknown and also enjoy them before
Which i couldn't guessed
Also cross which you couldn't get to enjoy or do /have
Maybe what if i could have them as tomorrow..
Maybe sort by most probably to less probably
Which you most probably will do n is preset to do
Update this regularly, this is not some regulars list
Only those of which you highly certain n not which are kinda impossible
This is awesome n gratitude tech
This is staying in present
This will make you sleep early
Life will rock
This gives energy n motivation
Live in tomorrow or today
More then expectations
Unexpected
Maybe create excel for it , soon/very-soon  , bingeable or not , duration , big , certain/probable/easy-to-induce.. , regular/again/  , today/tomorrow/weekend/..
This is Living on hope
Nothing could excite you anymore like the upcoming cool things
I found how to gratitude
Like real genuine one
Don't count the blessings of past, count the certain blessings of tomorrow
Tell me good things which are certainly coming tomorrow
In your life
Little little things too
Those which are coming
Only future ones
Like Tea
Not which did
Find similar things
Those which you are certain about
I'm excited for that
The thing is we try to see happiness in past, but it is in future.  See the exciting things that are coming soon.. Like for ex, I'm certainly spontaneously going to park tomorrow where there will be cool breeze, awesome open gym, awesome lovely girls, n later morning tea with friends
Which are coming
N you will be excited like a kid
Create a list
I'm talking about which are coming spontaneously
Like things which will happen without your effort
Create a list of such certain n spontaneous things
Which are coming in upcoming future
Near future
You will be amazed n excited af
You will get to check whatsapp again in 5 mins

With time, more such new categories comes
Mould all tech accordingly
This is good bcoz they are not single piece desires (like have a car) but limitless
Divide into memorised by association, and..
New.. Of what I liked/enjoyed today/yesterday
I want a future where I have lots of such to reminiscence of, and to do this. With great memory to remember atleast of recent two days. Work hard for this. 
When good moments that you enjoy happen, notice/live them strongly so that easy to remember
Which i absolutely loved/enjoyed
You'll not remember the pleasure of it if old than 2-3 days.. So, don't worry if you didn't experienced it by now if not regular these days
Increase your memory to improve your happiness bcoz you need to remember things that you liked or enjoyed
Write number of "new.." I'm having these days averagely.. N log increase..
Get "new.." points from maybe that excel doc
Slowly-2 your mental muscle of remembering things will get strong
write here all things that you enjoyed today bcoz we can truly be grateful for only those things properly which we truly enjoyed
write here all things that you enjoyed today bcoz we can truly be grateful for only those things properly which we truly enjoyed
i request lurkers to think of things they truly enjoyed today
even if for a sec
no need to write here
just think of things that you found yourself enjoying
and you will found happiness
this is the strongest gratitude technique
dont mentally create things
but think of actual things you found yourself enjoying/liking/satisfying/savoring today
whether it is cup of tea , or some book , or a person
no need to create a list
just mentally
don't include things you want to manifest
things or activities
this is bulletproof way to instant happiness
You may either hate or regret it later but if in the moment you enjoyed it , think of it
Maybe in variable amount
If you found yourself enjoying a lot of things , it means you are living right and your past efforts are of worth to take you in such present. And so this will motivate you to do more efforts so that in future , you can find yourself enjoying various things
This will make you do things for future happiness rather than immediate happiness bcoz this tech will make you happy. So , you don’t need anything for current mood.
yes but this technique will become burden if
you try to relive or relive those moments..just think and they will automatically play in mind if they do
don't include things you trying to manifest
Don't try to log them
Don’t go beyond today
The reactions you loved
Even if Passive fun/like too
Things I like these days n potential they have
4-Jul-18
5:40
Which i actively like, not passively
These days or today or now or..
Only of present
Which i really liked or enjoyed this month, even for a little time
Why latest - bcoz you have active alive passion for them, the passion is still alive n not dead yet or reawakened
Group by high, medium, n low interesting potential
Group by amount of like
Group by how much time i like
Potential same in future, like now
Maintaining the present comfort or lifestyle
Past compare to potential
Just imagine the potential
You will automatically remember the potential
This will motivate for future
Wonderful
Interesting practical or dreamy potential
Even if you like only 2-3 things in present bcoz you will always be liking one or two always, n you can use those to escalate or motivate yourself.
Potential's'
Be as if what if i have loa power n dt power full, how it would be then
I would be doing this instead of this
Doing n did
Like kissing that girl
Potential of choices
Pubg - pubg pc, fortnite, skills, tips, strategies, other such games, ping, internet, whatsapp group,..
Nasheedha - enfp, love, polyamory, chattings, gifs,
Sleep
Health
Girls in park

Particulars
You are motivated for those desires but not fully but half heartedly, how to make them burning desires.
Imagine that how much you would have used it, and in those situations if you had it by then.
That loa tech
List of situations you want to rephrase
Decision
English toilet
Alternatives, how much i currently (not in past) dislikes or hate or cannot like rinku aur, peeking, sitting on ghutnas, their shit unflushed, no water, etc which that alternative enables.
Likes comes from dislikes
Gratitude comes from..
This is using bad things too, baazigar,..
What about those things you like bcoz of just Boredom ex coffee. Well, don't you hate Boredom. Also, you like coffee bcoz you cannot hate it. Also you hate just drinking tea,
You hate things you couldn't like
You hate things that are forced on you maybe
Hate, for ex, in revenge is the purest feeling, that also makes you alive
Just find out things you 'currently' dislike and things you currently like (bcoz of some currently dislikes) and mould motivators acc to that.
Things you couldn't like

Note - in future or near death, only regrets remains of not tapping the full potential in the past. So, this is the main tech. Your main desire is not to tap that potential but to be able to do something regarding it
No, the real regret during that time is to not to be able to enjoy all that again or to do something regarding them n not about new desires
You don't know the fun of future but you surely know the fun of past
This is respecting what we had
Imagine a future where
Happy people
Futurology
Desired things
My desired world -
No religion
More research on loa and synchronicities
Emotion - excited] I want to be in a future in which I'm excited for future
In future, the way you think will change. So, it's not like that you will be same in future. Your glass with which you see world will change.
Create a log of such changes
Dt, loa etc
The way you think, the way you see world, mindsets
The way you solve problems
Changes in beliefs
Aim for maturity
The way you handle/see problems and sadnesses will change
Emotion - simple-mind] One day, life will be simple. 
Life and everything will feel simple
Not minimal but simple n easy
That einstein quote about 5 year old simple..
Simplicity is the sign of maturity actually
Life, mind,..
No overwhelment and complexity
Mind all time stages in future
Instead of only happy
Lucid
Drunk
Intoxicated
In flow
Adrenaline rush
High
Silent and at peace
Hyperactive
..
I want a future in which I'm more interested in present then future
I want a future in which I'm happy with my present and want to continue that present in future
Be happy for future bcoz you gonna have so many days to be in present and to enjoy present by meta desires.. Like binge etc
You should want to be fit bcoz it will help you more to enjoy your present, it will put you in present
A future in which I've have collected so many ways to be in present moment
Others [adding/imagining fun to ppl , follow fun people , personify , interesting lives stories and characters, ]
-------------------- 
-------------------- adding/imagining value and fun to people lives
When others r or will be sad , how can you enjoy life b/w such ppl
In future, i can provide value to - family, my friends, people on whatsapp, people on reddit, girls i love, local people, everyone....
In each field
Instead of only one person which is you
Detail, with detail in one person, same with all
..
I'm meaningful for -
My family
My friends
My future workers
My followers

Don't find meaning. Be meaningful to people you care about.
We are meaningful for each other

[12/12, 4:43 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): All living n inanimate things
A future where everyone everything around you is full of gratitude, without any complaints
[12/12, 4:59 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): When i tried it in visualising, everything feels awesome
[12/12, 4:59 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): No rat race, no cut throat competition
Visualise a future where everyone around you is passionate about something
Visualise everyone around you as laughing genuinely. Not fake laughing but genuine giggling. Not in mocking way. But hearty pain in the ribs laugh. And you laughing like that too. Imagine a future like that.
Visualise you remember about some funny memory or someone telling you good jokes
Some funny memories -

- etc..
Energetic means - energetic, full of life, full of desires, positive,..
Imagine everything around you is happy. That furniture, that wall, that car, that animal, that human.. Everything n everyone happy
This is also how you would feel when you are on recreational drugs. That everything everyone around you is happy
Happy, contented
Living or inanimate things
Everything
Bcoz its hard to be sad in a happy world
We usually only try to visualise only us as happy and forgot that our happiness can also be affected from outside. So, why not visualise your surroundings as happy too
And it's hard to be happy in a sad world (no matter how much Buddha you are)
Raise the vibes of the family -
Only then the mood for development will rise and other tensions will get away
Parties

Laziness - it generates ideas
Bad government - it unites people to revolt and rebuilt
Failures - it build your character and make you smart and..
Selfishness - you can't remove world hunger being hungry yourself.
9-5 job - it teaches you discipline, how to do things even if you don't want to, how to team up,
3rd world country - sometimes a mess is needed to build something totally new
Breakups - you may Google law of attraction
Losing things - you'll get to respect things you have and you take care of them
Cursing - nothing releives you of that stocked negativity like some good cuss words. Just, make sure, to not use them on undeserving people
Negative emotions - you can use these in law of attraction
Sexual energy - you can use this in your loa experiments, and to shape yourself
Not knowing things - you can learn it later too. No time is bad time.

Also imagine, 4 hypnotized security guards who will be with you everywhere bcoz one can't enjoy properly without safety
Introvert, cozy, safety
Imagine being happy from others happinesses.. Like taking them to enjoy those things n places. It's tiring to be happy n you can't digest all happinesses but it's easy to digest happiness that comes after seeing others happy. Feels same but chewed. Like you are eating chewed food instead of chewing by yourself. This time, it's happiness instead of food
Friends, kids, family, wife, whatsapp people, Mbti, poor, those who are passionate for it, 
This is how universe enjoys too.. It strives on chewed happinesses
Concept of chewed happinesses
Imagine you sitting somewhere and you have the options to do anything from those 6 options.. Feel the excitement and the order you would want to enjoy them. Imagine the anticipation
Imagine watching porn in those places shown in image randomiser
Untethered
Imagine yourself thinking why not I have efforted for it earlier n how i would have it earlier..
Imagine you sitting there with the knowledge that it is waiting for you
Laughing
Bored
Thinking
Imagine you there thinking of the current mood and the conviction you did in yourself to get to this
.. And it feels like a winning or result or deserve..
Imagine you excited for future with your friends and loved ones. Usually you try to imagine yourself excited for future alone but imagine yourself excited for future with your loved ones. Mutually excited
Personify the things that help you daily (to feel connected to them)
This is like gratitude in a way
This is like feeling that you have so many friends
The book "lost connections"
Be as if it is proud of me of what I've achieved using it
Pc - Mr amd, the black buck,
Mobile - miss xioami redmi

Die empty
One of the most beautiful  book to read is "Die Empty" by Todd Henry.
The author was inspired and got this idea of writing ??this book while attending a business meeting.
When the director asked the audience: "Where is the richest land in the world?"
One of the audience answered: "Oil-rich Gulf states."
Another added: "Diamond mines in Africa."
Then the director said: "No it is the cemetery. Yes, it is the richest land in the world, because millions of people have departed, "they have died" and they carried many valuable ideas that did not come to light and benefited others. It is all in the cemetery where they are buried."
Inspired by this answer, Todd Henry wrote his book "Die empty." Where he did his best to motivate people to pour out their ideas and potential energies in their communities and turn them into something useful before it is too late.
The most beautiful of what he said in his book is: "Do not go to your grave and carry inside you the best that you have.
 always choose to die empty
The TRUE meaning of this  expression, is to die empty of all the goodness that is within you. Deliver it to the world, before you leave
If you have an idea perform it.
If you have a knowledge give it out.
If you have a goal achieve it.
Love, share and distribute, do not keep it inside.
Shall we begin to give and remove and spread every atom of goodness inside us.
 Start the race....
Die Empty

I have dt , most not than y ... ?
Subconsciously
Unknowingly
Intuitively
It's good to have as many as possible problems detected and written and their solutions discovered and written
David Allen book "getting things done"
Don't be happy of people ignorance about dt. That they are stuck in a job.
They don't utilize opportunities
They ignore being informed of their ignorance. They are comfortable in their ignorance.
They too get the points/ideas , how is another issue . Universe/god/Loa works in mysterious ways
Loa is helping them
People have "maybe using just brain" sort of techniques. Everybody have some natural variants of dt bcoz of experiences and "mbuj.. Brain things". They might not know consciously but their  soul might know it partially or fully
They could have dt too but they made bad choices which they couldn't find time to reflect on. In ignorance or they have dt in some form but couldn't apply it properly and enoughly
Don’t think that you couldn’t manage so much points in dt bcoz only u r so descriptive and detailed , people on net for ex subreddits like lifeprotips n seduction n social etc details such tips at great length ,so u r not the only one
Might be that I m premature baby and so dt seems extraordinary to me but is actually incorporated in other lives as basic common sense
The happy and managed people must have dt in some form in/with themselves.
Don't think that they don't have dt. They must have it in some form.
Don't think that a person couldn't have Dt in that position, status or job.
More successful you are , more the chances that u have Dt (in some form)
Many people use OneNote and other softwares and ways to keep them managed , some used diaries etc. Some keep structures in mind.

[09/05, 1:57 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Found some controversial loa techniques
[09/05, 2:01 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: You know when they say don't compare with your friends and other people , and don't pity other people
[09/05, 2:01 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Right
[09/05, 2:02 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Now we are using exactly these to raise beliefs
[09/05, 2:02 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Bcoz even if these emotions are negative
[09/05, 2:02 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: They are pure and strong
[09/05, 2:02 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Negatively pure but pure nonetheless
[09/05, 2:02 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: So
[09/05, 2:03 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: If a guy near you have money less then you , you will be like , dang , he is poor , so poor , this will make you feel rich
[09/05, 2:03 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: I know , I know
[09/05, 2:04 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Highly controversial tech
[09/05, 2:04 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Use the hate
[09/05, 2:04 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Similarly
[09/05, 2:04 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: If your friend have a car you don't have and it's better then yours
[09/05, 2:05 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Then create a list of such people and friends near you who are really living life better then you
[09/05, 2:05 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: This will make you feel that you too deserve things
[09/05, 2:05 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: And why should you be left behind
[09/05, 2:05 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: This will help you
[09/05, 2:06 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: Although in a weird way
[09/05, 2:06 AM] Aditya (INTJ 5) ??: But help for sure

You don't know that (2) doesn't mean that u don't know this (1)

They may possibly might not be thinking specifically about you among so many people and their own thoughts, fears and complexes.
They can think that. Don't worry. Y u think they are thinking only this and in negative light

They aren't entitled to you.  
give them respect acc to their level,  not your weakness otherwise they will stand on your head

Not pain body
They are frustrated people who only can mock others
Social confidence
Saturday, July 18, 2015
9:42 PM
It ain't just give you confidence but power, defense , protection , opportunity to revenge too
What impresses them :
Not just your style etc but your richness in all sectors , way of life etc , confidence , etc. Silence
Introverts doesn't necessarily means that..
And extroverts doesn't necessarily means that..
Calm, composed, confident rather than loud, abusive
Your work/status will speak/impress rather than words etc
Be as if that hurting/mockery/insult/etc doesn't affected you at all
Weak knees affects my confidence outside when I m standing,  so try talking and make sure you are sitted
Positive cool confidence rather than aggressive confidence
Look serious and sophisticated and classy
Everyone gets bullied and harassed and treated bad in some way by people (all those traits from doc - understand ppl) . Difference is they learn to how to react to it internally and externally.
Every rich/strong/etc person have enemies/ppl-stronger than them and is affected or mocked. So
..
Be angry that they are seeing your modesty as weakness, taking you for granted, not powerful, u hi, kya ukhad lega. They aren't considering your pain bcoz of them but intimidating you directly thinking you as weak
They are affected/impressed/impacted the way you were trying,  u maybe can't detect the symptoms but give it some time bcoz they might be hiding/not-revealing it
Weak Legs n therefore balancing etc are affecting my confidence outside
Don’t be confused about your intentions ,if you don’t trust or respect your intentions than how can them ,how could you expect them to trust/respect ..
Why you ego n uneasy of their trust in you over this or that . Stop feeling guilt pleasure in shaking their trust in you
These are my people, my roads, city etc
It happen there too but it doesn't mean that they don't do something about it, they also doing that about it
They are just some big Kids who act like this n that n are utterly confused about life
Very imp-  How to positively(not actingly) overwhelm your mind in front of them so that negative thoughts and complexes won't influence you or how to handle awkward silence : Mental singing , busy in dt , in phone,
Difficulty in standing bcoz of weak legs negatively affects my social confidence
I can daat ddy from which whole college students fear. So in some way , I m bigger than those students and I can act like that
Motivate yourself for others help

Principle of mutual benefit
Spreading dt gives me satisfaction,..
How much dt helped and is helping you, Imagine dt helping crores. Imagine the betterment of the world.
Dt is bigger than me.
World needs love and guidance.
In past, you'd also expect guidance like dt from someone. And today you have that so you should know that someone out there is expecting guidance like dt too
Karmas
They will respect and love you
Respect their choicing , not choices necessarily
Motivations about people
Not all of them are bad. They want happiness. Even if they are bad ,don't see everything as bad. They are not universe. Don't blame whole for them. They may look big in number but they are nothing in comparison to universe.
Misguided
Misunderstood
They feel guilt of bad things
Ignorance
===========================
Feel their pain , need , want , desire for it
Remember their help to u
Even if they are asking in a not so motivational way
Feel their pain n frustration
Care them as u care yourself
Many of them are helpless , vulnerable , misguided , disturbed , tortured
M) Why they are such
Tuesday, September 8, 2015
8:49 PM
They don't want to retract/revert bcoz :

What what you don't like about the world
Just reverse what what you heard negative about the world -
Corruption
Bad governments
Climate, pollution
Poverty, gap between rich and poor, unemployment

Health, diseases, ageing, malnourishment, hunger, substance abuse
Over population
Racism
Spiritual void, extremism, religions

Note - Google global problems and issues, third world issues maybe, per country maybe,
Also write truths, facts and good points under each
Divide by serious, medium, low
five that concern me most are the risks of global pandemic, financial collapse, world war, climate change, and extreme poverty
Exponential progress in science and technology
Futurology
Internet
Memes
Awareness
Collective consciousness
Growing interest in New age spirituality like law of attraction
Maybe being us top in species or food chain
Maybe youtube
These are declining -
extreme poverty,
child mortality
LEGAL SLAVERY
EXPENSIVE SOLAR PANELS
CHILDREN DYING
DEATH PENALTY
OIL SPILLS
NUCLEAR ARMS
DEATHS FROM DISASTER
HIV INFECTIONS
BATTLE DEATHS
SMOKE PARTICLES
HUNGER
Countries with smallpox cases (of 194)
OZONE DEPLETION
LEADED GASOLINE
Plane crashs deaths
Child labor
Small pox
These are increasing - basic education, literacy, democracy, vaccination,
Choices of enjoyment are increasing
So many more could be added too!
We're currently living in the safest period of human history.
**Every** type of firearm death/injury continues to plummet (in the US and around the world).
We **just** crossed a threshold where, for the first time in human agricultural history [the majority off the world is now middle class or richer](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/09/27/a-global-tipping-point-half-the-world-is-now-middle-class-or-wealthier/).
Extremely poverty continues to fall hard.
In short: the future (or the distant past if you happen to be reading this from the year 2100) is going pretty well.

*join movements*
All of us beleives in some things which we feel that they are beneficial for the world and we want them to be popular.. But we can't do that alone, and we as humans live very meaningless lives if all we do is just find fun and meaning in our lives.. Yes.. Even if you are finding meaning in your life apart from fun.. That wouldn't be enough bcoz we as part of whole.. Can't see a world which is meaningless in itself. So, we need to make this world a meaningful place and not just our lives.
Find things that you feel that whole world should have more of that to be a good meaningful place
Like this loa thingie.. Dont you all think that this should be more popular, practiced and experimented all over the world to make this world a better and meaningful place
Find things that you feel that whole world should have more of that to be a good meaningful place, and than find people who also beleives in that.. And you get a movement
If you a movements guy, you'll be immortal because you are a movement now and movement never dies, and they are the best mixture of introvert and extrovert bcoz movement passion originated from your own beleif (introvert) which other people also beleive (extrovert), and you desired the element of the believe in the movement, it adds a flow in your life, and add a meaning in your life
Y
To be immortal
Mixture of both introvert and extrovert

How can we support in movement -
Beleive in the cause
Internet
Add others
Associate with other movements
Passive and active
Be up to date with news
Motivate those..
Save those..
Fight the enemies..
Loa
Give them ideas, think for them, give them Epiphanies. Bcoz if that idea is good, it will spread through people
Most valuable input is your revolutionary thoughts on the topic
Find movements you love to think on
Be more like scientist, rather than seller
Create/innovate things highly useful for society.. Like bulb or phone etc
More like join groups where people brainstorm mutually...
Experiment..
Loa, pua, showerthoughts, movies
No need to support movements via old ways of physical fightings and childish ways, be smart.. Use ways like loa etc
You are in a movement just if you think like that.. But that is Passive way to be in a movement.. There is active way to be in a movement
Via internet
Ex -

Join already running movements
Movement that arise from things you truly hated/hate
Fight against aloneness
Fight against dowry
Fight against..
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_movements
A movement is not necessarily against someone
Creative problems..
Personal..
Maybe join only those movements which are getting successful so that..
Choose your battles
Ratan Tata dreamed of nano.. A car for everyone
Startups cash movements like.. Zomato solves the problem of going to restaurants, amazon.. To stores,..
People who think and beleive in same and want others to know benefits of
Live in movements, live through movements
Live a collective meaningful life
We can't live a meaningful life as an individual when the whole world is on fire.. Bcoz we are part of whole and sooner or later that whole will affect us.. We can use air filters in our house when the whole world died of pollution but soon you'll run out of air. We can live a meaningful life only when the meaning is associated to a movement to add meaning to the whole world
Evolution is nothing but collective effort of the whole to add more and more meaning to the life
Also nothing unites people like a common cause , In which they beleive personally
If you even beleive something that others too, it is a movement.. Like free internet
Movement is when many people agreed on something
Movements or beliefs you passionately beleive in, that this is what earth truly needs
Try to make money too from movements to financially support yourself as bonus and necessity but don't upto point that it diverts or affects movement
Main thing is being the movement, the journey..
Feel the meaningfulness whenever you hear positive development regarding movements you follow
Keep a log of movements progresses

Intj hobbies [16]

Which habits and why
================================================
There's a list of similar questions in the Wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/INTJ/wiki/index#wiki_intj_hobbies
From what I've seen, a handful of people on this subreddit program. I love programming and am currently studying it in university, but I'm a kinesthetic learner. I have to sit down and do lots of exercises before I get a grasp of it. Programming is hard for me as a hobby because it's not often that I have time to sit and create things in that manner.
I've programmed most of my life, but only do it as a hobby. I do work in IT, though, that does allow me to use programming to get tasks done. I also indulge in learning about cryptocurrencies and mining it.
Programming (made my own OS, a network-based rogue-like, a DOS GUI (don't ask), and others
I'm not much of a collector but I did stumble upon Linux From Scratch yesterday and was pretty intrigued! Is that what you used?
No, as in literally wrote one using Assembly and C. It didn't do much, but I wrote my own bootloader which loaded a kernel into memory and started some basic programs up.
Oh geez. Props to you my friend. I took an operating systems class that went over assembly and C and I died a little but everytime I walked out.
I like keeping aquariums
That sounds like it would be pretty cool. I just don't know if I'm disciplined enough for that..
Try writing a journal! I know it sounds fairly antiquated since so much of life is already easily documented through today's social media, but it's definitely been one of the best things for my own mental stability in the past few years. I feel like the tendency of INTJs to get wrapped up in our own thoughts makes it very easy to fail to keep track of the general upward progression of life, but keeping a journal forces you to go back and recount everything of significant impact, be it positive or negative. I only update mine on a monthly basis, filling it in with notes that I jot down on Google Keep each day, but it's proven to be a worthwhile effort even at that sporadic of a frequency.
Also related to this, bullet journaling has been great for me. I log my habits and anything I want to keep track of, I make a lot of lists and plan a ton. I just started a new one exclusively for work and it's helping me be more productive AND letting me feel a lot more relaxed at home since I've got my thoughts down on paper, not just milling around in my head 24/7.
If you Google bullet journals you'll see a lot of the more aesthetically focused ones, because it can be a creative outlet for some people. But really, at its core it's a great productivity tool and it's super easy to adapt to fit basically anyone's needs.
I've been trying to get into journaling more but struggle to keep up with it. I totally understand the benefits, but I don't know. I just haven't been committed to it. Maybe I'll try it out for a month and see how I like it!
One thing that helps me, and it's probably just related to my aesthetic love of paper materials, but finding a journal/notebook that is high quality and something I want to spend time using is imperative for me. I cant just use a regular notebook. It has to be something that will last and that I will always love to see on my bookshelf.
I also use a really great fountain pen that makes me want to write everything down. The combo satisfies me deeply.
I've switched back and forth between a physical journal and a virtual one. I still haven't found what I like best but I'm leaning to a virtual journal more and more these days
Can't blame you. I did virtual for many years and also kept the paper one. Writing really is a lot easier and faster with a keyboard.
That and I like being able to change my thoughts. With a handwritten journal, everything seems so... permanent. It's obviously not, but I don't want to be crossing out everything and then making changes to the point that I can't read what I wrote. Just my 1.40? ($0.02).
I like photography, editing photos/videos, reading, road cycling, hiking, going to the gym, c++ programming and currently learning game development in unreal engine, playing video games, cooking etc.
Sounds like you do enough to keep you busy for a lifetime! I've been looking at road cycling but being at university, I don't want a nice bike to get stolen after making an investment.
I can totally relate, I used to live in one of the worst cities for bike theft so I was really anxious about my bike getting stolen. I would recommend getting a kryptonite lock and maybe even storing the road bike inside your apartment/room if you have enough space (when you're not using it). I currently leave my roadbike in my hallway, and I have a cheaper hybrid bike without clip-in pedals that I use for commuting. I know getting a bike is expensive on a student budget, but it can save you money in terms of commuting, exercise (not having to go to the gym) and so forth.
I've heard about the kryptonite lock before and would definitely look at one of those for what I need. At this point, I would be trying to keep it as cheap as I can because I'm sorta banking on the fact that it'll get stolen at some point while I'm at class. If things go well, I figured that buying a bike would be cheaper than the yearly parking pass that I'd completely outrageous.
I can get on board with all of those. Seems like you spread yourself out all over, which I find to be a good thing.
Storm chasing, traveling, yoga, reading, math.
Storm chasing, that's a new one. Sounds interesting though!
Board games sound like they'd be right up your alley! They certainly fit all 4 of your criteria very well. Depending on what you want out of them you can get simple, quick party games or deep multi-hour games that rely almost on pure strategy.
Also video games for a similar reason, especially the ones mentioned in this thread.
I've been thinking about board games, especially D&D, so maybe I'll give them a try!
I used to play video games, but then one day I kind of just realized I could be doing much more with my time. It's not that they don't add value. I guess I just haven't found the right one.
Yeah with video games it really depends on the game. Some are almost completely mindless, some are too complex to figure out without spending dozens of hours. I'd check out that thread.
I think I saw some good ones on there. Thanks!
Video Game Collecting
Electronic music production. It can be really frustrating at times but the endless creativity does compensate this drawback. Also you can feel like an engineer because it can get quite technical.
How steep is the learning curve?
It used to be steep back in the days when there was little to no guidance and learning material. Now youtube is filled with introductory courses and such. You just have to pick the program you want to create music with (FL Studio being most popular for Windows platforms and Logic being most popular for Mac users) and get rollin'.
At first everything will seem so confusing but I think you will get grasp of it pretty fast, especially if you are older and have had some experience with other similar (in complexity) programs such as Photoshop.
If you keep at it you could create pretty decent music within couple of months. The one thing that you really need and that can't be taught is creativity. I have been making beats for 4 years now and while my music quality is that of semi-professional releases I still find it really hard to finish projects due to my perfectionist nature. Hence the frustration part in this hobby. One suggestion that really helped me become better at writing music is to work really fast. You got to be able to finish your project from start to finish in a matter of couple sessions. If it drags on longer it probably means this project is going nowhere.
That doesn't surprise me that pretty much everything is online. I think that would drive me crazy too. I could see myself creating a sound and then not liking it so I spend forever trying to get it just right. I have been trying to get more creative so maybe I'll look into that. Thanks!
Yeah man, that's why I advocate producing a finished product as fast as possible. You want to finish it quickly while you are still on your 'producer's high' - when everything you do sounds good. Because the longer you work on a track the more you start to get bored of it and hesitate whether it sounds good. But anywho, good luck bro, I think this hobby is well worth looking into!
Photography, photo editing, playing tower defense games, reading technology articles, and mechanical keyboards.
I did a little bit with photography but never fell in love with it. As for your mechanical keyboard hobby, that's an enjoyable but expensive one!
Fishing, hiking
The outdoors are cool, but I just haven't fell in love with them yet! I'm still waiting for the day...
You should embrace it. Silence, solitude...
I would like to recommend a book to you.
The complete Angler (the art of recreation) by izaak walton
I'll check that book out, thanks!
Learn to solve a Rubik's cube.
I can see that but once you take the couple hours to do that, it almost becomes mindless after that unless you try new algorithms.
Oh not really. The biggest part of the progression (at least for the cfop method) is becoming efficient at F2L and learning to look ahead. Basically being able to predict the state of the cube before you do moves. It's actually a matter of thinking more than it is memorisation
Bladesmithing, woodworking, reading, loud music, the likes.
How'd you get into bladesmithing?
Honestly, YouTube. Tutorials on how to make your own forge, how to handle steel, copper, silver, etc.. There are lots of videos on how to do everything, but finding a place that has classes or a friend who does it helps a tremendous amount. I found the latter.
I was gonna say! Not sure if I have anything (or anyone) in my area for that unfortunately.
There are places that have classes available both in northern and southern US (if you're from here). The classes cost a decent amount but they only last a day or two. You walk away with a ton of hands-on experience and your own tools. If you're outside of the US, I wouldn't be able to tell you where to look, unfortunately.
I'm in the US and will take a look at what I can find. Thank you!
Yup! If you're anywhere in the Midwest, there's a great place near Superior, WI I think.
Are 3D printers expensive nowadays?
Gotcha. It seems like it would just be an initial investment and then buying materials for printing as you need them. Seems like it would be pretty cool!
If you want something physical learn an instrument.
Or exercise, like bodyweight fitness it can be done anywhere.
I'm always off and on when it comes to fitness. It really just depends on my schedule and class load.
Tasting wine. It's easy to get into, has an insane variety and depth, gives you much to learn and you will meet interesting people with the same passion.
Cheers to the username.
Do you have any good resources for getting started?
The winefolly book is a very good introduction: http://winefolly.com/book/
Of course, there is tons of information available on the internet. But with wine, tasting experience is more important than reading. Depending on where you live, a good idea is to start with some basic grapes. If there is one, visit a wine shop and ask for a Merlot, Cabernet or Shiraz. (Or Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc if you go for whites.) 699.15? (10$) per bottle is a good start.
The next step is tasting the wine with the approach of getting deeper in in and identifying the main compinents of each grape. (Like smelling the pepper in Cabernets.) Just watch a "how to taste wine"-video, it's a matter of 5 minutes. The most important thing is smelling. Your tongue can only identify 5 different flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter, umami), all the rest is actually a combination of retronasal scents.
The tasting experience gets much better if done with other people. (Tasting wine has increased my total number of friends from 1 to 10!)
I've always enjoyed wine but I have never taken the time to appreciate it. Maybe I'll get started with it and try to find some wine tasting places near me. Thanks for all of this my friend!
One of my favorite hobbies is exploring the depths of my mind with psychedelic drugs. lol. I've had some really bizarre and enlightening experiences. Its fun. I recommend drugs to everyone.
But I also like to lucid dream, code, draw and train mixed martial arts. Next I'd really like to learn acrobatics, I've always wanted to be able to do a backflip.
Drugs aren't my thing so I'm gonna have to say no to that, but I can hop on board with the acrobatics. That stuff seems really cool and it could get you in good shape.
Table top role playing games... specifically Pathfinder.
I'll have to check that out!
I love every strategy game such as chess for example: I don't train like a pro but I enjoy playing and that's enough for me.
Also, I like trading, even if I'm not sure that could be considered an hobby. Actually I have to study a lot to understand what to do and I can't do it so much because of the university, but I try always to improve.
What programming languages do you learn? I'm trying python, but same as trading, I should have more free time so my progress are slow.
I've been thinking about chess for sometime and I might give it a go to see if I like it.
So far I've learned Java, C, and Ruby. I'm not particularly skilled but I like to think I know a decent amount. I've been meaning to get into Python, but I just haven't found the time to dedicate myself to it
I played the ukulele in the past so maybe that'll end up coming back to me.
Unity is damn fun.
Gl with Unity :)
I've heard nothing but good things about unity! However, game development just hasn't been my thing at the moment.

I have a few hobbies, some with people, some solo.
Solo is watching TV/Movies, which is related to my career so I can convince myself that I'm doing it for career advancement ;). I also play piano and some video games. Reading.
Group hobbies are mostly D&D and Magic: The Gathering. It's funny I'm as far from a programmer as can be, but MtG is such a programmer's game. It really appeals to those with that mindset. You have to be very precise, plan well, execute things in the right order, manage resources. The game is all about issuing commands in the right order, the place where the commands wait to be resolved is even called the stack! I've been playing since I was a kid, but it took me a while to realize all the best players I know were basically all programmers, and I put it together.
D&D is nothing like that, and done right can be very social and full of imagination. They fulfill both halves of my personality quite well; I'm a technician in an artistic field.
I've been thinking about Magic and have heard some good things about it. Maybe I'll check it out some more!
As for D&D, my friend and I are thinking about taking a look at that as well. Both seem promising at this point.
Magic can be an expensive hobby. I dunno if you wanna take that jump haha. Very fun and gets you thinking but I don't blink at spending 2,796.61? ($40) on a single card anymore, and I'm a filthy casual by most standards. You can play way cheaper, but it can definitely spiral out of control.
D&D is great, I'd suggest 4 people if possible - 3 Players and a DM.
I've definitely heard before that Magic is a black hole that just sucks you in along with your money. I guess it goes to speak how much people enjoy it though! Either way, thanks for the info!
I do have a couple of hobbies but my favorite one would have to be piano. I've been playing for over 10 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon.
Close second is photography. More of a group activity though since I like to shoot portraits a lot.
I've always wanted to get into the piano but don't know where to start and don't have the time + money for lessons. It's a rough life...
Actually I think piano is easy to learn, but hard to master. Since its not like a violin where you have to stay in tune, in piano you just press keys (technically).
I don't think it's too late for anyone to learn piano, and it's possible to learn without spending a lot of money. If I were you, you can start learning through YouTube, and if you can't buy a keyboard check your local churches and ask if you can use their piano when they don't have service. For lessons, you'll need a teacher eventually but in the early stages I don't think you need a teacher. once you can read notes and know your music theory, you should get a teacher. If you really want one, consider the price they're charging and their reputation. My professor charges 100/hr (rip my bank account) but I am applying to conservatories and she got her undergrad and masters at Juilliard and her PhD at UCLA. But I think in your case it's possible to find someone anywhere from 20-4,194.91? (60 dollars) an hour that teaches well.
I don't know if you'll start learning, but I hope you do - being a pianist gives me so much enjoyment in life :)
I can tell you're very passionate about it and appreciate you sharing! Thanks a bunch for the information!
I'm looking for a new hobby. I've tried various things before, but don't really have the patience to get through the tough learning stages before I'm really good at something. Also, I'm just impatient in general, and want to see results somewhat immediately. Things I've tried: writing/blogging, food photography, yoga/fitness, golf.
I play the trading card game Magic the Gathering. It was the first trading card game, and has consistently been the most popular (with the possible exception of Pokemon for a short while). I pretty much just play the 'limited' format tournaments i.e. the players buy cards, play with those cards, and get to keep the cards no matter how badly they do.
Just about every Friday, around the world, many game stores hold Friday Night Magic. This usually involves a draft tournament. This is a limited format where players each have three booster packs (a pack of around 14 to 15 cards). They begin by opening up a booster pack, picking a card, and then passing the remaining cards to the next player. The cards keep getting picked and passed around the circle of players until there are none left. The same is done for the other two boosters. The players can borrow basic land from the store (basic land are cards that are used to pay for the in-game cost of spells, abilities, creatures etc.). The players are given time to construct a deck with the cards they picked. Usually there are three rounds of best-of-three games.
I also play MTG and almost strictly limited. If you have a group of friends that you play with or buddies at FNM I would recommend buying a cube of a set you like or proxying any cube. I have a vintage cube with power9 proxied, an innistrad block cube and a pauper cube.
There will be a small initial investment on the sleeves but it can be great fun, and save you money in the long run if you don't care about the cards you open for constructed.
Here are my zero-experience perceiver questions about this:
don't you just end up buying more and more cards?
if you are bored can you play by yourself?
how much should you budget to get started?
if you just went to your local drug store and bought a small foil pack was that a grave mistake? Can you immediately play with it?
If you proxy a cube you don't have to buy any cards just the sleeves and you can usually get the lands needed for free from a local game store.
You can, but most people don't, at least with paper cards. If you don't have a friend available to play with or don't want to go to a store to play you can play online. https://goo.gl/8OnSOO It costs 699.15? ($10) to sign up, you can draft and build a deck immediately. Though the user interface is not the best and will take some getting used to.
That all depends on your own disposable income, and it depends on if you want to play constructed or limited.
I'm not sure what you mean by small foil pack, are you talking about a booster pack? You can play pack wars with a single pack as long as you have lands. How I started and what I would recommend is find a friend who has expressed interest in learning how to play. https://goo.gl/iuRFSU That video with teach you the basics. Then buy a duel deck together and start from there. https://goo.gl/wN4uT2 https://goo.gl/mpmga1 either of those are good choices.
It was daunting for myself to go to local game store and try to play with experienced players, but I found that most of them were very helpful and friendly.
If you have any questions shoot me a PM.
Here's a weird one that I'd love to see more people take up: K'nex guns. The objective is simple, build something out of K'nex that shoots. However, there's a lot of room for innovation and problem solving as you start to accomplish things like making repeaters with as much range as possible that are quick to reload. The barrier for entry is small because it's a building toy, you can just follow instructions for a small, simple 10 piece gun to get immediate results and then work your way up from there. You generally start off by building other people's creations but once you get the general idea of how to build different parts, you can start experimenting on your own.
That actually sounds really awesome
I've been meaning to start a video guide series to introduce people to the hobby and get them started in hopes of getting more builders in the community. I'd just have no idea where I'd begin looking for interested people. If I knew anyone here was interested, I'd start on them sooner.
I'd watch :) depending on how much it would cost to get into it, I'd probably give it a try too. I say go for it. This seems like the kind of thing that would interest many. Try posting the video to a couple of subreddits.
Awesome, nice to know. Well, it kinda depends. You can pickup one of those generic K'nex tubs for like 1,398.30? ($20) which should have enough to build some small guns but you really don't get your money's worth. Personally I just buy my parts in bulk from Ebay and the K'nex website. The nice thing is it's a very expandable hobby, buy as much as you're comfortable with now and it'll last a while, but you can always add more if you want to build bigger things or more things at the same time. Like, some people have made large cannons before. Of course, some rubber bands are necessary too but I assume most people have at least some lying around.
I would definitely get into this
music. i play bariton in a marching band. very intersting but it takes while to learn it properly.
besides that: (almost) any sports where you have to move a ball with your bodyparts anywhere (soccer, basketball, volleyball ect.) and jogging. quick results and it's healthy (as long as you don't ruin your keens/ankles with too quick movements)
Things I keep going back to: gardening; sewing (by hand so far); refinishing furniture
Things I didn't love: crochet; cross stitch
New things: knitting (love it!); canning; spinning my own wool (drop spindle)
Things I want to try: sewing machine, loom (want to make my own fabric), sheep raising, wood working, and opening a small business.
Right now I am working on a knit baby blanket and some hand sewn hot packs. I find I like hobbies that are useful and create something I can use.
You're mistyped.
Dare I ask why you say that and what type you would guess I am?
Well, only sensors can do physical work...
But seriously, your hobbies just seem unusual. Consider that you're an ISTJ or ISFP
Well, only sensors can do physical work...
Haha, that is great.
On a more serious note Intuitive vs. Sensing is not about what we do, but how we think. My husband laughed at me when I let him know I might be a Guardian type. He said I was way too messy to be a Guardian. As for being a feeler...my T is one of my weaker attributes, I am definitely a T, but my F attributes do come out from time to time. It is possible my hobbies are a reflection of that, but I find it unlikely. My husband who is the most INT person I have ever met enjoys knitting and cross stitch, his main hobby is programming (actually it is more of a life style choice, but whatever), but he is still crafty when he is in the right mood.
I use my hobbies as a way to destress. They give me time to mindlessly use my hands while giving me the chance to process what I have learned that day. When I am knitting or sewing I also get a chance to future cast and play scenarios in my head while keeping my hands occupied.
As for my hobbies being strange, they very well might be. But, if my hobbies are strange, what did people do before the invention of the computer or even electricity for hobbies? INTJs did not pop into existence with the computer and we can not all be experimenters. We all work with what we are given. I come from a family of crafty people, it is what I was exposed to as a child so my interests developed in that area. My husbands father would bring home spare computer parts so he developed in that area. It is what we do with that exposure that makes us who we are.
I breed plants and chickens (not together... I have no idea why I felt the need to clarify that), forage for mushrooms and plants, seek out new and unusual foods, self sufficiency (someone else mentioned it, pretty much learning everything I need to so as to need nobody), chase fleeting creative pursuits, study quantum physics and medicine, get drunk/high/listen to music and have fun in my head.
What kind of medicine do you study?
Whatever piques my interest or I delve into in hopes of helping a friend. Some interests last, some don't. I've been studying Lyme disease the last several years being that a friend was misdiagnosed for so long that it became chronic. Then dealing with it again when my SO got it I was able to catch it immediately, and in myself too thankfully. I realized doctors around me are not familiar with it, so I decided to get familiar in hopes that I could help others and I have.
I'm also versed in sexual health because I have found it's an area people tend to not be totally honest or comfortable with telling their doctors about. People come to me with their personal stuff. Other times they come to me with things their doctors missed (usually simple stuff that just lacked the hallmarks or didn't have enough symptoms present at the time). I do my best to figure it out and point them in the right direction whether that be doctors I know to be good about listening to their patients, or if it's pretty cut and dry or the issue is more of an insurance problem I'll send them to other channels.
That's really cool, thanks for sharing your experience. I'd like to get more into that kind of thing. Sometimes I find it exhausting, though, to try to research medicine, due to e.g. somebody publishing studies that seem well-done, but also seem to be meant to justify their current entrepreneurial pursuits, like selling a cure for autoimmune diseases.
Conlanging. It can get as involved as you like it. I also identify with the impatience, which is another reason (of many) why I suspect that I might have undiagnosed ADHD.
But conlanging seems like it would require tons of patience? Tell me more, I'd like to try it because I'm already into neography.
As long as you have a good grasp of grammar in the abstract, the results are more immediate than neography IME. I can bash out a crude reference grammar in about 2 hours or so. Refining it is the hard part. That's also the stage where I usually end up scrapping my work. Is there anything specific you would like to know?
Thanks, what sorts of things should I know about grammar in the abstract? For example, at a very abstract level, I know that it involves meanings and probably words. But if you asked me what a participle was, or a gerund, I'd have to go look those up.
One example is how inflected you want your language, and how regular you want the grammar to be. Natural languages like Latin are highly inflected, but the word order is very free. Conversely, Chinese lacks inflection, so word order is relatively fixed. Pro-tip: languages feel more artificial if the grammar is highly regular (e.g. Esperanto). Basic word order is also something to think about early on.
Edit: forgot a word.
i've decided to become a sorcerer, in the sense the word is used in anthropology, meaning a mostly secular professional user of magic. i've been buddhist for 25yrs and buddhists disdain the use of magic. at the same time, i've studied the myths and legends of bantu africa extensively, even learning swahili. though i was trained in hard science (mathematical ecology/epidemiology), science is not my religion. it's a way of accumulating facts, via the scientific method, and the body of data so accumulated, nothing more. thus paleontology isn't science because you can't gather experiment data. i also went through a phase as a psychonaut/psychedelic explorer. i've even met a couple of gods, one of which told me, 'tomorrow you will want to rationalize this experience. that's fine, you may. but you need to understand that just because you can rationalize anything, that doesn't mean that irrational things never happen. never lie to yourself rather than accepting that there are things you cannot understand.' so i know exactly how to be a sorcerer, i've just never bothered.
to start with, i'm making a charm/talisman based on old hoodoo/voudu to keep away police, adding a verse from the i ching. i'm learning the i ching, via copying it out in chinese (i speak japanese and most of the characters are the same). i'm studying the trickster gods/spirits, as part of being an assertive INTJ is taking down hypocrites. besides, i grew up on uncle remus and can thus claim br'er rabbit as a tutelary spirit.
how's that for a hobby?
Cool! Fascinating. Chotto chigatta kedo.
Stalking people, observing what they do, keeping a log on it, and after a certain period (like a week or something like that) you switch to someone else. This is even more fun if you do it with elderly people and include taking pictures and you do it until they die, then you take a picture of the dead body and lastly of the grave and then you go to the next elderly person.
My usual hobbies are a lot more boring though, admittedly internet trolling can be very entertaining.
One of these hobbies is not like the others.
Edit: spelling mistake.
Ah [hArDc0r3] people watching.
Unless you're really talented in something, everything takes time and practice to get good at. To get really good at something, well, there are things where being super analytical just doesn't cut it anymore.
Find something you like. Even just a little. Stick with it.
You can try out other things in meantime, but don't drop that one, whatever thing. Over time the experience and practice will build up and you'll find you actually are pretty good at that thing.
Lucky for me lots of things are connected to my job, so my job is my hobby. It's usualy extra-stressful, but because i like it it's just stressful.
3D projection mapping. I started this after I got burned out on playing music and didn't want to become a DJ like all my peers.
I'm also a crafter but I haven't yet tried new hands-on hobbies like pottery. I don't know if you would try to become a very avid reader? It'll consume your time and it is of course not hard to do. Finding a new hobby is easier also once you figure out why you are necessarily looking for a new hobby. Do you just want to pass the time? Do you want to learn and challenge yourself? Do you want to use your hands or any part of yourself in particular? Do you want to improve in an area of your character? (example, you said you don't have patience but do you want to improve on that or no?)
Have you tried to run a farm of dwarfs?
If you answer is no, then i have something for you.
Its like run an ant farm, the only diference is that the dwarves are "intelligent", alcohol-dependent, humanoid creatures. They are well known for their stout physique and prominent beards (on the males), which begin to grow from birth; dwarves are stronger, shorter, stockier, and hairier than the average human, and have a heightened sense of their surroundings. Dwarves live both in elaborate underground fortresses carved from the mountainside and above-ground hillocks, are naturally gifted miners, metalsmiths, and stone crafters, and value the acquisition of wealth and rare metals above all else.
If that doesnt give you curiosity, what if i told you that nigth creatures roam around the dark, bloodlusted and ready to start a massacre or kidnap their childs to enslave them an get a lot of "fun".
for more information, you are welcome in /r/Dwarffortress.
What are your guys favorite things to do as INTJs? I'm either working on some challenge or project that I enjoy or watching some hockey those are mine. I also really enjoy reading books on topics I'm interested in.
I collect threads!
I have found a gold mine!
Gosh, you're right. Holy shit this is amazing.
Gaming (both video games and board games), Programming, Guitar, Books
What language do you program in? I do Python & C.
I've been learning Python recently. Programming is also my career, but I do it for fun too. Most of my experience is with .NET C#, but I have some Java experience too. A friend and I from work have been playing with Python for the Raspberry Pi, lately.
I've been very interested to talk to an INTJ who is a programmer.
I chose it because, for me, programming is like a puzzle. You have certain "pieces" (decisions, loops, etc.) that can fit together in certain ways, and you use those pieces to accomplish different tasks. I find a lot of pleasure and satisfaction in that. When a program works and does what it's supposed to do, it feels like solving a puzzle to me. There might be a unique solution, or there might be a dozen ways to accomplish the same thing, which is what keeps it interesting to me. And as to your last point, programming helps me think in even more logical steps, which I find helps all my analysis. Having said all that, it's not for everyone. You have to learn to think by breaking everything down to it's most basic tasks, and not everyone who can do that enjoys it.
Nice! I'm in cyber-security well I'm gonna be. So many fun things to work on.
I play the yoyo because of its thereaputic effects and its amount of self satisfaction. Modern yoyo has developed a lot with a really tight community as well.
Look up kendamas
Ah, yeah I've seen them. But yoyos seem to have a bit more to them...I haven't played a kendama but I think the variety within the trick elements in yoyos and the ability to be creative is really cool.
Here's a short video about why some of us yoyo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J81dSkLOWY
My full-time hobbies are purging personal belongings and hoarding animals. My other less time consuming hobbies are pursuing a more sustainable and green lifestyle, reading, trying new restaurants, playing word games, oh, and I also hoard plants.
My favorite thing to do is crush the souls of others.
Ugh, this sub has become such a bore lately.
Yeah its pretty boring, mostly people who are new and/or arent INTJ.
If we wait long enough will they leave?
After checking the archives, it's been a couple of years since this has been asked, so I figured I would ask again. What are some hobbies you have that fit or, better yet, don't fit the INTJ stereotypes?
I honestly use about 85% of my free time playing Cities:Skylines, a city simulator. I build insanely detailed regions, and carefully manage everything from public transportation lines to city budgets. Currently I've spent almost 500 hours of my life playing this game.
And reading, volleyball, drinking copious amounts of alcohol with my best friend.
Thanks for pointing out my typo. I didn't double check the question, but I made sure to go over the text at least twice. :D
reading, intensive learning about topics of interest, hiking, boating, biking, architectural design and drafting, playing piano, yoga, art and history museums, botanical and sculpture gardens, classical and instrumental music, theater, cooking and baking, woodworking, video games, making board games, watching favorite show reruns and literary adaptations, basketball practice with my teenager, going to the library, sewing, porch sitting, meditation, lyrical and tap dance, dumpster diving or scavenging building materials and things to upcycle, sketching, watercolor painting, volunteering specifically with Habitat -the food bank-and natural conservation projects, chatting on the phone with my mom or sister, archery, rv-ing, traveling
Jesus, you must be my doppleganger, lol.
Sounds exhausting but rewarding haha
deleted 0.4291 What is ^^^this?
Bedroom music producer. Learned guitar, bass, drums by ear. Graphic design. Tutors enjoyed reading my papers and I enjoyed writing some of them. Riding a roadbike, solo. Tennis. Video games have always been around.
Only tennis requires a second person.
Mine are all pretty typical for a female INTJ, I think - generally solitary activities:
Cleaning/organizing (weird to list it as a 'hobby', but it is something I spend a lot of time doing and take pride in doing well)
Do you know of a guide of how to start up woodworking as a hobby? Also how much space is really needed?
No really... I just found projects I thought would be interesting and started working on them.
As for the space it depends on the projects. I am in the process of finishing my garage and plan to have a decent space in there to start building cabinets and furniture but if you are doing smaller things like kids toys or turning projects you could probably get away with a decent sized work bench and a scroll saw.
This post could've been written by me. I'm trying to finish up a night stand and plan on putting a floor in my garage before turning it into a dedicated shop!
YouTube is your friend in this regard because that's where I got my start.
But IMO, to really get started, you don't need a whole lot. More tools is always good, but you can do so many projects with a circular saw, a drill, and lots of sandpaper. Seriously, don't think you wont need that much sandpaper. Get the big packs.
As my garage is in dire need of a floor not made of dirt, and windows, and electricity, and a door thicker than 1/4 plywood, I end up doing most of my work on the back porch. If you want dimensions, any space you can fit your tools and yourself in and swing your arms is big enough.
Go to a pawn shop and get some tools,and get some 2x4s. First project could be a couple of sawhorses!
I homebrew. It's something I can do with my hands, I can do it by myself, it requires thought, it saves me money, and I get beer/wine/mead when I'm done.
I have been interested in this for a while. Any pointers?
It will appear daunting at first, but it is not that difficult. There's a lot to read and research and its all on various websites online. Start off with howtobrew.com. They break it down very simply. r/homebrewing is another good place.
I probably invested 6,991.52? ($100) to get started and so far have invested around 69,915.20? ($1000) but I've made all that back in booze by sticking with it.
I see. Thank you. I have been lurking in /r/mead.
Thinking, reading, listening to music, watching arthouse films, walking, sewing, cooking, drinking wine and/or craft beer, reddit.
You sound fun. :)
Which craft beers are your favorite? I enjoy them as well.
I'll drink most things. I'm not a huge fan of lighter beers (style, not alcohol); I live in a cool climate so I enjoy stouts, brown ales, many different IPAs... We have an excellent craft beer bar in my town with up to 15 beers on tap. I often go there with my brother on a Friday night and we usually sample half a dozen different ones between us.
The only light beer I enjoy is produced by a company called einstök. That sounds like a excellent bar. I have been going to a taproom.
Composing music, making games, lifting, reading/learning, watching great films (Blade Runner). Programming is a fun way to build systems if you haven't already tried it.
Haha, those are also my core hobbies - composing music and programming games. Awesome :)
That's funny, are you looking to get into working on games? I am a music composition major and then I do sound design and programming for my projects with friends. Also, chess is another fun hobby.
What programming language would you recommend?
Python if its your first language, it also depends on what you are planning to do with it. I am biased to C# and C++ because they are commonly used in game engines. If you're looking to do some serverside programming then like Java or webdev like JS, PHP, CSS.
Endurance sports, especially distance running.
Taking my dog on long walks and hikes while listening to educational podcasts.
Running thought experiments through my head.
I wonder how many INTJs are runners or like individual endurance sports?
I love cycling. In fact, it's the only activity that helps with my depression. I get on the bike and pound out stress for an hour or so. No deep thinking. No angst. Nothing but my legs churning out the revolutions.
I do. Or at least I did before I hurt my knee. I'll recover eventually, though.
I would assume that the types most into physical activities would be Se dominant (ESFP and ESTP), but running may be different. I think it may require more effort to stick with it and follow through than other sports, and running is usually more of something done by yourself instead of in a group.
While you are having problems with your knee checking out cycling could be a good idea. I myself also enjoy running but because of various reoccuring problems with my legs i decided to take a break and look into other individual sports like swimming and cycling which i have found that i highly enjoy.
Cycling is also very low impact, so you are less likely to get injured.
Me too.
I crave it. I feel a very strong desire to be physically active, but the idea of playing team sports does not appeal to me at all. Throw me in a pool lane or on a mountain trail and I'm happy for hours.
Exercise also adds a significant amount of structure to my day. Not sure if this an INTJ trait or part of my upbringing, but I feel the need to schedule my day out and be productive, check boxes and stuff.
Running also gives me metrics to play around with. I see it as a data-collecting game. With GPS watches and even smartphone apps as high-quality as they are now, it's easy to collect a lot of data about runs and quantize progress or plan future workouts.
I would hypothesize that introverts in general are drawn toward individual sports, because they require an individual to be not only comfortable but content being alone for significant periods. I know many of my runner friends are introverts--we never run together, because most of us use running as an escape from our jobs, which require us to be more extroverted than we'd like.
I agree with all of this. I love to run,hike and bike. I don't mind soccer but I usually tended not to be a team player. I'd just kick the ball as hard as i could away from the other team typically toward their goal.
I cannot stand running. But I have asthma. So that has a lot to do with it. Feeling like I'm about to die because I can't breathe isn't fun to me.
PC Games (RTS, turn-based strategy, and city builders), poker (live and online),
city builders
I would like to recommend Tropico. Check it out on Steam.
That is actually my favorite one! PM me if you wanna play Tropico 5 sometime. Multiplayer is really fun in the rare case that you find people that have time for a full game.
You probably wouldn't want to, I am horrible at making money. I just sit and play on unlimited money and build.
The main problem I have is that, I expect such hobbies either to be useful somehow or fulfill my (nerdish) fantasies. If I notice it can't be the case, I drop it. Besides the videogame already cited, there is martial arts, programming (which by chance is my profession as well), and "functional" calisthenics (gotta be ready for the zombie apocalypse). I would love to learn to fight with swords, but it would be hard to consider it realistically functional.
Few recent that I dropped were electric circuits and assembly programming language. After I tried a few exercises and more elaborate stuff(at least for a beginner level), I left it behind. Sure I could advance on it but, nah.
This sounds spot on with me, even down to the electric circuits and assembly programming. Things like that fascinate me, but ultimately will likely never serve a practical purpose to keep pursuing (though I get randomly in the mood and crank something out). I've had so many potential careers with my hobbies even, but get bored and move on. Programming has been the main exception so I've stuck with it.
My interest never fades in any given pursuit, but I certainly find myself more engrossed in discovering new things. Learning languages for example, I always want to try a new one out, but always come back to Japanese. Learning is the passion and medium is irrelevant.
Yes. I tend to jump from activity to activity. Not necessarily new interests all the time, but they get mixed into the cycle. I would not call them fads since it seems more a matter of picking something up for weeks or months, then drifting away from it for awhile while I pursue other interests. I usually get back to it later down the road. When I do pick up something new it tends to become an intense obsession during the time it holds my interest.
My boyfriend is the INTJ and he certainly does. He always does art and music, but there's always a third one rotating around too. Right now he's trying to carve a pipe out of soapstone but I don't know if he'll finish it or not before he comes up with something else to do.
I find myself looking into so many different hobbies but only focusing on one or two because I invest so much time into them.
Yea but sometimes nothing else to do so stick to tired out hobbies. :/
I wouldn't say quickly, but frequently, sure. I tend to go through hobbies like a pair of pants. I wear it out, then I'm done with it. Sometimes I come back to it, but it often takes years to cycle back around.
Yeah actually, interests cycle very quickly but only between the same couple of things. I don't usually discover brand new interests all that often.
Jack of all trades, master of none.
Yup. Get strongish b 295 s 405 d 495... Then proceed to slow down or stop entirely to begin again later. Stupid cycle
Yes, usually when I learn how things get done I lost my interest. But there's always exception, I guess you just need to wait and find something you are really connected and interest in.
Have for years.
I tend to have a hard time getting into new hobbies. I went through the gambit of sports when I was kid -- had zero interest in any of them. But I love reading and have always loved doing so. I've been asked to try other things -- pathfinder, hiking, skiing -- but none of them real pique my interest. I'm good being at home with a book and a movie on, while my pup is curled up next to me.
Yes i change hobbies a lot, i have a hobby for 3 months, use a lot of money and time on that hobby, and then i move on to something else.
Kinda. I do until I find something I'm actually passionate about.
Basically just hobbies that you don't tell people about unless they expressly ask or bring it up. Some of mine: lockpicking, Android app inventor, card tricks, inventing things.
People watching.
Me too!
I didn't know people watching was a hobby, more of an automatic response to your surroundings :P.
I like people watching but I don't go out of my way to do it.
Same, I do it without realising.
I confess - during my high school I managed to monitor electronic communication of approximately 30% students in my class. The things I found out ... it was like a drug. Illegal and every time I read something I wasn't supposed to I got insane rush.
Damn, I wish I had figured that out in high school.
I'd have been rich off of the blackmail money.
I also invent things. I have over 100 inventions in "written idea" phase, and a few that made it to the rough prototype phase. In my experience, others will usually make fun of you for inventing things, unless you strike it rich. My wife ridicules me and rolls her eyes. What can I say? We have a cynical society. People think you're just wasting your time unless you are making money from it.
I've heard people say, "You should sell that!" so many times. I really just prefer to develop/make things for myself, I don't care about making money off of it or the hassle that entails.
Hmm. I'm the same way, but I usually get bored before I finish developing said thing and go develop something else. Rinse. Repeat. :/
Annoying sometimes, because I do want to complete something, ONE thing. I guess I just haven't found that one thing yet, apparently. :\
Yup, same here. ADD for me. Though I have it managed to where my interest will eventually loop back and let me finish things. I see starting new projects as just being part of the process now.
Oh yeah, I loop back occasionally on certain projects. I set out to accomplish a certain task within a project, accomplish that task, get bored, move onto something else. Move onto something else. Then head back to original project and do another task.
I do a similar thing with business plans. I find a need in a marketplace and then solidify the marketable idea, assume the primary processes for the business to be profitable and operate, then imagine a corporate structure necessary to accomplish this, finally I write it all down and never act on it. I enjoy discussions with entrepreneurial people, I'd be a godsend to an angel investor and be perfect as a COO.
I'm also regularly thinking of gadgets, innovations or improvements to existing devices or systems.
MBA? I need a few of you who have the mind for this type of thing. I know some MBAs and patent attorneys, and have other friends with useful skillsets like this but my real problem is I am in a risk-averse situation right now. Namely limited assets, wife who refuses to support this type of endeavor etc. Paradoxically, if I had enough money to comfortably quit my day job and start one of these various businesses (based on those parameters), then I wouldn't need to.
You have a simple solution: find a business model with limited outlays, low risk, requiring little effort. Do you have an invention that could be created on a 3D printer? How about hand tools? Take that idea, make a product and sell it. Start small and grow big.
Perhaps, like some folks, you have a really expensive but valuable product in mind? In this situation the solution is simple: sell it before you build it. Think of kickstarter as a tool to get you off the ground. Then, for your subsequent rounds, sell it before you produce it.
I think you've got your priorities backwards if you believe you need a bunch of money or strong skill set to start a business. I look at a business as process oriented: you only need to get the processes defined and you'll be making money. So, what are the things that you need to do in order to make money? Probably sales/marketing, production, delivery, and business management (accounting, mostly). Figure out those processes, outline the steps in the best detail that you know them. Now, how many of those processes can you do by yourself? Do you know how to sell your product online? If not, find someone to do that for you, give them a fair cut of your revenue, and now you have a business! If you have appropriately planned, each time you go through a complete process loop you will generate money.
I’m open to continuing a dialog.
If we tell you they wouldn't be secret now would they.
We're all the same here, telling us would be like another conversation with yourself in your head!
Nothing specific, I'm always into some new "self-improvement", usually small skills or tweaks I can learn or improve upon. Like learning how to tie some knots.
EDIT: Changed the letter "t" into a "w" which simultaneously changed the word "hot" to "how" and formed a coherent sentence.
If you haven't already then you should look up Ian's knot, a faster way to tie shoelaces. I feel like I'm saving a lot of time because I have to do it everyday.
Nice try, NSA.
Do you ever shoot black powder? It is a ton of fun.
It is. My dad makes flintlock rifles. He's making me a pair of dueling pistols.
This. Prefer most of my rifles, but every once in awhile black powder is a ton of fun.
Exactly, I love my .22 for target practice, but my black powder rifle makes such wonderful sights and smells. I can't hit the broadside of a barn with, but boy is it fun.
Indeed. Haven't used my .22's in a long while, bullets are rare right now for them. Been using my dad's .30-06 a bit as we won a second one, they are pretty fun as well. I use it for deer season
They can be pretty accurate if they're made well.
I've shot a musket once. That's about it
It's probably not as weird as you think, most of the people nowadays will have grown up with a console. Half my driving music is OCReMixes :)
ocremix? :)
It is now normal many young musicians are even going explicitly for this type of thing.
Besides: what would they tell you? You're weird? Just reply: fuck off - I am an artist and a connoisseur while you can barely watch rugby and chug beer!
Even better :) Old-school chip-tunes were the best! For video-games I feel the more limited the better - only a few looped tracks meant you had to strip the song to it's core musical value and same with 2-dimensions and the game-play.
I do hate chip-tune remixes that still sound like chip-tune though. Better to hear the original in this case and they aren't very listenable except as soundtracks.
Here is an example of some chip-tune remix that sounds like a chip-tune.
Now if you like some Castlevania...
See, I don't consider that Sonic 3 thing to be chip-tune at all. It just sounds like synth to me. Sure, it might be FM synthesis, but I wouldn't consider any FM synth to be a chip-tune. It would have to be a specific FM synth such as the one used in the Sega Genesis. Is the synth lead in that track being produced by a particular chip that you know of?
And that guitar player is legit. That's not an easy track to play on guitar.
I seem to know nothing about chip-tunes. What I mean by chip-tune is that it sounds like video-game music - which is awesome while you're playing but to listen to in other contexts I like remixes to sound more like traditional music.
So you like virtuoso Castlevania guitar covers? He is Brazilian - cheer for us in the upcoming game today, will you? :)
Ah, yes chip-tune can mean just that. I usually try to distinguish authentic chip tunes from electronic remixes of game tunes. I also prefer live instruments though.
If we are trading Castlevania done with live instruments, try this one!
Castlevania III - Clocktower by housethegrate -- La Hora Es Tarde
Ah, gothic salsa - my favorite genre! How did you guess? ;) This is going into my collection.
I am all out of Castlevania. Can I interest you in Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross or Final Fantasy VII?
... do tell about the scam baiting
Rubik's Speedcuber.
video please. for the brotherhood.
Here I am in my prime.
Nicely done. good job I'm so proud of you.
Dude I do the same thing, but I'm not as so serious about it.
I have bought a speedcube though but its more just something to play with when the computer is loading or im watching tv
I draw, and generally do art. No reason to advertise, so it's a secret.
I'm a graphic designer/illustrator so everyone knows I art, but I don't let anyone see my own personal projects.
Being an artist, watching LCS/league pro gaming, horror films and watching crime documentaries/reading about serial killers. I don't mention them unless asked really. My friends think I just play video games all evening.
Do you play it yourself? I love watching LCS as well.
Yes I do :) LCS is great. Though OGN is better sometimes because of how small the american LCS champ pool is... and EU isn't much better. OGN throws out some random interesting things sometimes!
I really like OGN with its very professional atmosphere, but the matches are a bit predictable. EU LCS has gotten a lot better with its newer teams (Roccat, especially), although I still prefer the NA LCS to it. The teams have certainly gotten a lot better. While C9 remains my favorite team, I like that there is actual competition.
I agree the shift in team performance in EU and US is refreshing :) it's just the comps get a bit repetitive at times. Hopefully it won't be so bad this season!
The Sims, cleaning my house, sleeping.
I spend probably 90% of my free time looking up all kinds of stuff on the internet and absorbing information. I don't know what to call that particular hobby... reading non-fiction and reference materials? Those are my favorite book types, anyway.
I spend probably 90% of my free time looking up all kinds of stuff on the internet and absorbing information.
This human gets INTJs, cuz this is ~97% accurate for me too. :) In almost my own words.
I call it information mining.
I'm officially adopting that term. I use to call it going into information absorption mode.
Can confirm that absorbing all kinds of information is a go to of mine. I recommend Vsauce on YouTube for those who are unaware. The 'math magic' video is good and has an awesome description of 52 factorial and the shuffling of a deck of cards.
I just discovered this forum and now I believe I am in heaven. In regards to the topic, +1 and add Cities Skylines and Programming.
What is the story with the cleaning? I simply cannot stop!
Regarding cleaning, I do this quite a bit too. I think it's because I'm a control freak and like to have control over my environment. It also gives me a sense of accomplishment when everything is organised, neat and in order. It makes life more efficient, and I'm always reorganising things to try to maximise efficiency in my life and minimise time spent on mundane tasks.....
+1 for the Sims.
I'm the same with thin internet and reading non fiction information. I love to learn more about anything and everything that takes my interest.
I'd love to learn I just don't find most things that interesting unless they're written well and in an entertaining manner (usually using sarcasm and randomness thrown in) if you have any specific recommendations on good reads like articles or books I could find online that'd be great.
It depends what kind of things interest you.....some of my favourites include www.marksdailyapple.com for health and fitness info that's always informative, well-written and entertaining and www.memoiresofaheroinhead.blogspot.com for some mind-blowing and poetic writing by Shane Levene. If there are specific topics you are into happy to let you know if I've come across anything related I have specifically enjoyed :)
I prefer practical knowledge and just about any fiction with swords in it if that helps.
I'm not especially into fiction with swords (more into gritty drama and social issues when it comes to fiction) so can't think of anything on that front for you I'm afraid but for non fiction Wikipedia is amazing. I could spend my life just clicking from one thing to the next to the next. In terms of practical knowledge I really just Google until I find what I'm after. I truely believe anyone can do almost anything with the amount of stuff avaliable online - from written instructions to apps to instructional videos - you can learn about anything at all. For example, I really like the app Duolingo for a fun way to learn the basics of another language.... And I have found some awesome handy stuff over the years - for example I found out that hairspray gets ink off things, so if you wash a pen and get ink over your clothes or a pen stains the lining of a bag you can spray it with hairspray and it comes right out when you wipe it. Hope that somewhat helps :)
I'm always writing on myself but Noone in my family uses hairspray so dang it. I've spent my fair share of time on Wikipedia but I always feel like I'm wasting time and not learning anything useful. Social issues are also boring to me since I've made up my opinions and fiction about them is usually too optimistic for me to take seriously as a story. I'm also not a drama person (I'm the guy that wonders why the character are so stupid) but mideval stuff like the Rangers apprentice is really good imo.
fiction, but prob the funniest book I've ever read: John Dies at the End by David Wong. (sequel is good too, This Book is Full of Spiders). much sarcasm. so randomness.
Very meme. I'll try to find them online, right now the only access to the outside world I have is my iPod :( No library even. (It hurts) Edit: I read the first 47 pages (the preview on Google) and it's pretty good.
I guess I'm not the only one. Most of my time I'm doing this. Reading fiction stories is such a great way to get fun.
Weightlifting and cooking
I thought I was the only one who liked weightlifting. I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to building with my hands, but I've always loved the idea of building my body.
I also love weightlifting and training in general.
Any finance tips you could to share? Have been considering starting a very small investment into shares etc but it's rather daunting......
Read Tim Hale's Smarter Investing.
Then read all relevant posts on /r/personalfinance
With low amounts of investing you are going to want to minimise all costs.
Thank you :)
Still on my front page :-)
Thanks!!! I didn't see that!!
None of my hobbies are inexpensive, unfortunately :(
Other than reading and learning.
There are other hobbies than reading and learning?
Growing stuff. Vegetables, flowers, orchids. I have brought several orchids back from the brink of death, to being able to bloom again. It is satisfying and solitary. Being with orchids brings me to another speed of time as they are so slow. You get to spend a lot of time by yourself in your head working with plants.
I took a Plant and Soil Science class in high school and I became so excited to learn that you can technically clone plants through cuttings. I am currently tending to 3 bougainvillea cuttings I got for free and they are doing well. I also love composting and I currently have invested in a compost bin called The Worm Inn. It is so awesome and very "set it and forget it" when compared to other composting methods.
That's very cool - I've considered buying a compost bin. We currently just have a pile which we throw stuff in to keep it out of the trash stream, but I'll look into the bin you use! Congrats on your bougainvillea - I love those. I do some Indian cooking, and I tried to start a curry leaf plant from a cutting (when you buy the leaves they are often on a stem), but it didn't work. I will try again. Do you put anything on the cuttings to get them to sprout or do you sprout them in water?
I used CloneX rooting hormone, and I originally had them in perlite but I switched them to water and they did a little bit better. I am still testing though!
So I guess I'm asking to see what hobbies people have that are engaging, intellectually stimulating, quick, and somewhat mobile. For instance, someone I met today is big into cryptocurrecy. I feel like that's an easy hobby to take with you wherever you go and one that's intellectually stimulating, but it's just not up my alley at this point.
My favorite hobbies:
Books Reading/Collecting
Manga/Anime Reading/Collecting
LEGO collecting (for a while, I had a huge LEGO city built-up)
...I just realized a lot of them have to do with collecting. I wonder if that's just me or an INTJ thing in general.
I love to read and write. I also enjoy world building and cartography. I usually make characters to go with my maps along with stories and historical background. I really want to learn how to play an instrument buy I have dumb little sausage fingers.
Is there anything in particular you do with the worlds you build after they're complete with stories/background/etc?
That's pretty incredible. Have you had any thoughts about turning your creations into a book?
Hey thanks. I'm not sure if people would be interested in that. But I think it would be fun to write, create a map and build characters. I also plan on building a map for a DnD campaign.
Even doing that would be pretty cool. Best of luck to you!
My favourite hobbies by far are reading and watching movies/shows but i'm also into learning new instruments. So far I only know flute, clarinet and guitar but i'd love to learn piano. Lately i've been interested in languages so i've been thinking of learning one.
I've thought about learning a language but the problem is I know I wouldn't be using it everyday. I don't want to put a lot of time into learning one to only not use it and forget it.
It's good to know a bit of some languages in case you travel or want to delve into pop culture/literature of other places. Nowadays with apps like Duolingo it's easy to practice a language with minimal commitment.
That's true. Then again, I don't travel all that much.
I really like drawing and reading (mostly researching scientific topics and philosophy or politics/economics). I watch YouTube videos alot to get knowledge.
I plan on learning to code or program, get into cryptocurrency possibly, and go running more (I used to do this more when I was younger).
I also like programming but only off and on, I just don't have a true passion for it. My other hobbies include guitar and writing fiction both I feel like come naturally to me.
Astrophotogaphy (definitely the low cost hobby /s )
3d printing
Sous Vide/Instant Pot/Halogen Oven cooking
Arduino/Pi development
The latter 2 are actually low cost after an initial outlay in cooking (if you have an appropriate phone VR fits there as well)
Halogen Oven cooking
I've heard of sous vide - which I want to try along with molecular gastronomy techniques - but not that. Does it use halogen bulbs, or what?
They are a cheap class of "turbo" convection ovens/air fryers that often use halogen lamps as heating elements. Perversely the best in class units such as the Oyama TRO-110C use standard heating elements. In general they are cheaper than convection ovens and have a larger volume than air fryers.
I included them in my trinity of non conventional cooking devices due to the complementary rock-scissors-paper relationship. Sous Vide is excellent at slow precise low temperature cooking of proteins (and much more) resulting in selective effects on the proteins involved. Pressure Cooking such as the Instant Pot is a sledgehammer of fast high temperature cooking. Proteins are generally reduced to fall off the bone levels, but veggies, starches etc. are very effectively cooked. Halogen ovens are even higher temperature with moving air (as opposed to water or superheated steam) and good at baking and air frying where it is all about the Maillard reaction.
The other critical aspect of all of the methods is that they are "fire and forget" devices. After initial prep you set them and go away. This appeals to the "baker" mentality. To quote the excellent book "Cooking for Geeks":
Most of us think of there being two types of chefs: cooks and bakers. ... Cooks have a reputation for an intuitive, “toss it into the pan” approach, pulling together whatever ingredients inspire them and correcting as they go. Bakers are typically described as precise, exact in their measurements, and methodically organized.

====================== ensuring desires
get rid of issues so that you can enjoy life as it is bcoz life is fun as it is too] Perfection
When you can't Get rid of bad memories of past , or the bad memories of past that can ruin future enjoyments
Imagine a future totally free from all the bad things/memories of past and present
Blood money tech
You hate future bcoz the things in future wouldn't be that great that will make the pain of past feel worth.. So, instead of trying to raise the bar of things you'll get in future, why not think of a future where you have forgotten about the pain of the past (not the useful lessons from the pain) so that every small happiness can make you happy and each small happiness feels like big bcoz there is no pain in past that you can remember that can make you feel that the happiness is not worth the pain you have suffered
Be as if you have forgotten about all the bad memories
Untethered soul
We judge the worthiness of results by the amount of efforts we did for them... But sometimes we did too many efforts by mistake or by wrong methods, and after so many efforts and pain, the result becomes like blood diamond.. Just like, after killing multiple people.. You may get diamonds but you can't enjoy the luxuries bought from them.. You'll hate yourself deeply.. But if we forget that the diamonds are from killings.. If we forget the pain... We can properly enjoy the luxuries.. Without regret etc
[13/01, 8:29 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Bcoz of killings, you'll hate the diamonds and the luxuries, and you'll think that they can't bring you happiness.. Actually they can bring the happiness in you.. Its just you are comparing that with the pain of the past.. And this association ruins the fun
[13/01, 8:29 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): If you forget that pain of the past, you'll be like a kid, who also don't have a past, that's why they can enjoy anything with great curiosity
This is also why sometimes bad people are happy.. Bcoz they don't beleive in karmas and they have forgotten or successfully ignore the ways with which they have earned the luxuries..
Karmas exist and they work.. But only when you beleive in the concept of karmas. They were invented to control the society, to make the society civil and obedient. Just like moms say to kids that monster will come if they do any misdeeds
When i have wasted so much time in past
When you lag in basics of your life
When you don’t have some basic things in future like good eyes condition

Face life but don't let it change your faith in these. Live life proudly and confidently with these
Dt
Dt structure
Innocence , originality
Right or wrong
Right opinions
Priorities
Never forget your base. If you were to living according to ddy, you would be like this -
Baggy clothes
Fat
Not going to park and health etc
No travel
Still at shop
Still going to Mt etc even after so much insults
..
When only 1 thing can ruin life or make life feeling sucky
When the future will not be fully problem free
You don't want to do efforts for a future, or better say, you don't want to gamble for future bcoz you see your life as fked. You'll not want to do efforts until you see or feel life as good. You are negative about your life. For this, do something that you can like or enjoy, like drinking something tasty for example, and while drinking, be as if the life is good. Gut gut gut... Oh fk.. Life's good. This will clear the negative conditioning about life. You can do anything that you like.. Just simultaneously recite.. Life's good
This is the proper way of gratitude
By using one thing, you are cleverly making your mind to be grateful for the whole life
This helps living in the moment/present
If one bad thing can make you see whole life as bad, why can't one good thing can make you see whole life as good
If one negative or boring or bad thing can make us see whole life as bad, why can't we use one good thing to make us see whole life as good. Eat something tasty and be like life's good.. Do any thing that you like and use it to make you repeat in yourself life's good life's good
I want a future in which these feel/look good -
Past

It's hard to motivate yourself for efforts and future when the life feels fucked up
Also in loa, it's hard to beleive in goodness if life feels fucked up

*sadness is a truth of life. Problems will always be there. It is like that black speck on a white wall. It motivates us for better. It will be always be there. But there are two types of sadness. Mostly we are sadly sad, depressively sad. So, aim for a future where if you are sad, you are happily sad. Not sadly sad*
Lightly sad, not heavily sad
Energetically sad, not tiringly sad
Sadnesses have weights
Positively sad, not negatively sad
Positively negative, not negatively negative
Sadness is driven by evolution. If we are fully content with what is, there will be no evolution and development. You know the saying.. Necessity is the mother of invention..  A little degree of sadness will always be there. You can see it as a little push by engine to an already running car so that it doesn't stop.
[21/12, 2:47 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Yes ofcourse.. But our reaction to the failure or unfulfillment of the desire can be either sad in a light way, or in a grave serious sad way
[21/12, 2:49 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): One sadness is flavoured with hope and light headedness, another one is by tethered heart, depression and hopelessness
[21/12, 2:50 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Suppose you are sad about not receiving 10 lakhs rs on time, which type of sadness would you prefer?
[21/12, 2:51 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): No doubt, sadness will be there.. In variable degrees but it will be there
Uses from past ,
R tai , jf - you learn to revenge , self-respect
Stupid family -
Puneet girl issue -
..
From failures
Sadistic
I already suffered two hdd corruptions
Something is better then nothing
Untethered and out of depression
You get a thing of rating 9, but you crying that it is not 10, but you would be crying for 9 if you got a thing with rating 8
Being on job, you couldn't have thought so many beautiful things
We can never be not sad. But mostly we are sadly sad. Imagine yourself happily sad in future
Little sad
Main issue with depression is it is highly addictive and immersive
Run or set those quarrel and cryings audio recordings in mobile on some schedule so that to get motivated in urgency way n to not get too confidante n comfortable
[19/01, 9:23 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Unless your motivation comes from within you, it will not persist. Those whose words are pinching you tells more about their character instead of you. Why you loving yourself via eyes of them, love yourself from yourself. Show them how to love yourself by loving yourself such that they will learn to how to love themselves. Their negativity is not productive.. They want to go upwards by letting others down, instead of going upwards themselves. Better ignore such people..
[19/01, 9:23 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Don't let yourself motivated or demotivated by external sources.
[19/01, 9:24 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Bcoz it is fickle
[19/01, 9:24 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Learn to motivate yourself by yourself bcoz then no one will be able to steal that motivation
[19/01, 9:24 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Don't borrow motivation bcoz then they can take it back anytime
[19/01, 9:26 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Some of my old friends used to passively mock me of my weight.. Today I'm fit then them.. Lost 30 kgs.. They started swimming before me and now I'm better in swimming then them.. More fit..
[19/01, 9:26 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Motivation comes from within
[19/01, 9:26 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Yes.. Mental diet
[19/01, 9:29 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And the way education is in India.. For me.. It would be an insult to be called as intelligent in schools.. Most schools are teaching nothing but shit. If you were bad in school.. Consider it as a praise
[19/01, 9:30 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Schools will teach everything that you can't use in real life
[19/01, 9:31 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): The only geography you need is the basic map of the city you are living in, rest is meh
[19/01, 9:32 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): They don't teach you the basic map of the city.. And they'll teach you detailed map of the country far away
[19/01, 9:32 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Schools are nothing but scams run by companies
[19/01, 9:33 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And most of the teachers are those who can't find job anywhere, so, they come and teach..
[19/01, 9:33 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Not all teachers.. But most are like that
[19/01, 9:33 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Who actively and passively make kids feel bad

You motivated bcoz of tensions or desires
Types of setbacks
If you are content with current freedom, know that, Current freedom is depending on - ddy, narang, neighbours,
I only learned one thing in life..  Nothing productive will come out of negativity
More successes, more expectations, more agitations
To motivate yourself, imagine that you will still have to do this, and you are doing it on exact 11th hr and in tension
Work as if you don't have.., as if you don't have the security of.., as if you are still poor n need to survive
Maybe meaning of life is to solve your messed up life
Benefits of sadness -
You can freely be sad
You are already sad , so , no fear of getting or becoming sad
You aren't that sad
You aren't sadly sad
You aren't that sad abt this sadness
10% happiness
Be deliberately sad always [not highly but somewhat so that you stop fearing abt sadness]

Deimmerse/Attachment (move to addictions nofap)
==============
Association/attachment
Attachment to things I have or don’t have or had
Fear about things :
Lost , harm , have to work hard again to regain etc ,
Why attachment is bad ? :
Attachment to things/collections is the reason of pain . I am worried whether I can have them or not after death.
Fun things are fun no doubt ,but attachment makes them problems
Things/ways sure are fun but attachment creates pain. Enjoy them without creating attachment. This tech doesn’t mean that without attachment ,you will be in fun but that you will just not be in pain or anguish etc
I fear death bcoz of attachments
Maybe that’s y poor people are so happy most of the times
--------------
List of things I m too attached to :
Dt , me , this particular I , past , experiences ,knowledge ,ddy ,my story and life
I fear socialisation bcoz of too attached to my fix image
I fear ..
--------------
Imagine that you have lost that
Feel gratitude/thankful for the amount of time you have it
Enjoy things but don’t let build/create attachment. Without attachment ,u unknowingly let good things come easily ,this is loa
Don’t worry , life will reteach me . Necessity is the mother of invention/reinvention
Enjoy it shanbhangurness , temporyness like a flower that blossoms only once every 100 years.

--------------
This tech is what I was missing for so long
Ways to remove attachment with this particular 'I' :
Be i-less, that is death, find 'permanent' ways to be i-less : (die before death is the way) 
Love
Suppose i m not here
Just don't see your i as anything different from other i's
Get rid of any i or particular i
Drop the attachment to this i, be as if this is not my i
Strategically, drop the painbody,
Reduce it, i m only that much i which is here and current, compare your littleness of your i to the unlimitedness or other i's here
Be as if i Don't have any i. See carefully and witnessingly if you've holding any i while doing it
attachment
Language is the barrier in dt evolution/re-discovery etc
Corrupted by language

Addictions/big-desires
Tuesday, August 11, 2015
7:34 PM
Balance/moderate otherwise sooner or later your other contradictory desires will force you to regulate your addiction and it might be the way u don't like.
Balance hard to maintain .loose motivation for other desires
Imp-  Big desires makes it hard to create balance in context of other desires and so in future I will regret the variety in memories missing.
If it is contradictory to other desires doesn't mean it is ugly. It just means it is bigger desire. Contradiction maybe ugly but desire is not.
These desires will suck all my brain feel good motivational chemical dopamine on themselves n leave nothing for other desires making me feel uninterested in them and thus making the range of diversity of my experiences very short and hinder many necessary time limited desires n opportunities too
Don't go to these desires to feel good bcoz they will absorb you n your time, energy, interest,... Etc
Off course you can sometimes let go but you should happen to them, not them happen to you
Prevent falling into such addictions
Beware of these desires esp when :
You are depressed or hopeless or bored or alone or feeling low or bad or ..

Transcend it to either revenge or either maybe compassion

It in that case instead of it in that case

Similarly with present
It is not bad but it would be nicer if..

Visualise yourself comfortably scared with it around
Scared/tense/overwhelmed/confused/unprepared/tensed/..
How much loss
Regrets etc
Quickly skim through..
Visualise how much scared you will be with it around
Visualising like this will slowly slowly make you comfortable with your fears regarding it
How much worse It can get
How much good it can get
Side bonuses
Imagine side effects solved by possible side bonuses of this or other desires
Visualise the desires which can solve it's side effects and maybe steps too
What would if ..
This confidence will do the magic
Visualise it as a side bonus of something and visualise it having side bonuses instead of side effects , this is positive thinking , you can exaggerate , relate your other desires as sidebonuses

This is affiliated by Loa
That I can oppose them in filmy ways
That they all are united
That they all are against me
-----------
Have so many desires and bigger desires that you don't feel gluttony/ego in a particular desire.
Maybe make the unfulfilled desires like shubhangi to be the big reason not to be ego of all other desires , to be the driving force behind all other desires.
If I have many desires or big desires than ego won't come in some desires or relatively small desires bcoz of the number and amount of all desires. So think big n u thus can prevent ego on some level. Iykwim.
Be as if it is not a desire/achievement but normal event.
As if not that big deal/desire
Be as if others may consider this a desire but not for me
This is not one time or something exclusive but a way of life , a lifestyle. Unique or less known maybe.
I deserve it bcoz -
Final edge of thought
Everyone is swarthy by nature and it is good n evolutionary
My pleasure is my first duty
Live rich
Bcoz life is short . Yolo
I deserve this bcoz I have my shares of hard work, bad times , ..
Not as rare but life style, regular general lifestyle n routine
Acceptance
Letting go
Fuck my ego.  Be clever
Don't ego bcoz it ain't permanent and also life is short and also see those people on highness, are they egoing,  also life is meant for fun
See since how long I am working/wanting for it mentally/physically/..
See how much they are advanced/progressed than me
Don't give extra priority to their little or rare help or goodness
They don't do daily exercise doesn't mean whole world is not doing , whole world is not doing doesn't mean it is wrong . It could be that they don't know about it or it's profits or even if they know it and still not doing it which means they are lazy and don't give a fuck doesn't mean that I shouldn't care too.
See those successful people and their successes
See the variety and amount of other desires
Will it look like in future, something to be ego of

Don't see anything as new but just repair of old, like to maintain the life you have but maintain in smart and upgradish ways. Better. You know deep inside that you do need to maintain things and life. Dont you. You can use this beleif. This handles ego too. 
See all tasks and chores as helpful not for something new but to repair what you already have. To maintain it. To keep them flourish. Suddenly you will want to do things.
Life is continously entropying.. You always need to hold things.. To manage, to repair
Buying a Lamborghini is not some exquisite desire but just a better repairment of the situation that you have a prius
You are just repairing that part of life where you own a prius
That quote you created long ago
Repairing the situation , Its about Repairing the present. Repair the present moment
You just repaired the music experience.. Soon you will repair it more
Repair the experiences
You have the present moment /life to repair.. You can repair only it.
Repair the same life
Repair it in multiple times of day
This tech will actually make you interested in turning your life
In improving your life, you are in competition with yourself
What if reversals keep coming
Damages to the repair tech mission today
High transforming powers sorted - loa, ppl, mind/dt, entropy,

Path of depression and laziness - Smell , fat , diseases , bad emotions , angry , home quarrels worsen , hopelessness , bad addictions , hard to recover ,  Darkness , ..
That’s y .. Don’t give up
Best way to motivate yourself in life for general is to see how boring depression is
Bcoz offcourse, if you are not motivated, you are depressed
Varying degrees
And just see how boring depression is
Darkness, hopelessness, fatness, sleepy, smelly,  diseases, bad emotions and moods, anger, hurting your loved ones and things, bad addictions, home quarrels, etc
That's what depression is
Life is everything except depression
*be happy and excited*
Bcoz
You have so much time left
You can do anything in it
Like a raw slate
Even suppose if you have 5 years left of life
That's 8760 hours
Nope wait
That's 43800 hours
Minus sleeping hours removed
Suppose 8 hrs everyday
43800-14600=29200
And you can use sleeping hours for lucid dreaming and comfort etc
So much
So many things you can do in those 29200 hours
And that's just 5 years
You just need creativity and imagination
Fill those hours with your desires
Live a rich life
If you guys need help finding your passions
I can help
Passions tailored acc to your personality
Just find your Mbti
And I'll scarpe most popular passions for your Mbti

So many books you can read in those hours
So many ideas you can have in those hours
So many desires you can imagine in those hours

Emotion - sad] In future, i want to be sad for -
- not getting girls even with abs
-
Note - choose your sadnesses
Note - for these causes
You are sad bcoz you didn't choose your sadness
Manage your sadnesses
For your desires, while working for your desires
Atleast meaningful sadnesses
For these failures
I want these failures, i want to fail trying these -
I want first world problems
See the problems kings or billionaires or monks face
Emotion - sad] You are sad now, you gonna be sad in future
*But*
Life should be to live such a way
*That*
In future, you can be able to recover fast from the sadness or any other negative emotion
The more fast you can recover from them, the more successful your life journey is to be able to get capable to recover asap. This is a mark of maturity and something to worth live for.
*For*
We can't ever get rid of negative emotions
*But*
We can always choose to improve ourselves to how to react to them and the way and quickness with which we can recover from them
My daily life should and can be better than this -
Late wokeups
Stuck in home and city and life
Eye pc..
Quarrels

No future is perfect, but have as less issues as possible. Imagine where you would be if you didn't did those things or did. Ex,

[21/12, 7:36 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Make it less meaningless..
[21/12, 7:36 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): It will automatically get meaningful
[21/12, 7:36 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Remove toxic ppl from your life
[21/12, 7:37 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Solve the tasks that are ruining your daily fun
[21/12, 10:14 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Create a list of funny moments of your life
[21/12, 10:14 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Whenever you feel sad , read that list
[21/12, 10:16 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): ?? I remember a memory where I was angry with dad, and I pulled the towel when he came from bathroom, he threw Frisbee at me
[21/12, 10:17 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): It was near.. He wanted to throw anything he find nearby
[21/12, 10:18 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): I was running and he threw Frisbee
[17/12, 12:54 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Don't try to visualise yourself happy. Happiness is nothing. It is absence of sadness and depression. And everything negative. Feeling happy means there is a state different to being normal and this itself makes happiness something exclusive and lucrative. Being normal is the default. Happiness is an illusion, perpetuated.
[17/12, 12:55 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Visualise yourself free of sadness, free of depression, free of tensions, free of tethered soul
All desires [emulate , immortality , binging , days ,  ]
------------------- all desires , age , 
When you can't fulfill all desires
When so less time to fulfill and enjoy desires
When life is not unlimited.. When one day you'll just die.. 
When old age sucks
How to enjoy all and so many desires
Imagine a future where you are not just quickly fulfilling your desires but also quickly enjoying/experiencing them, so that, you can enjoy more n more desires in time. A future where you get to experience 50 new desires within a day. N enjoying them simultaneously multitaskingly combiningly
That other realities tech
That image combination tech
You can enjoy multiple desires via ld by time dilations
Play virtual games with real life friends like vaibhav anuj arjun etc.. Pubg.. Feels like batch travel.. 
Note - You hate life bcoz you either want to enjoy all desires or none at all
You would want to feel that you are fulfilling and enjoying multiple desires. Thats the feeling you want
-------------------- emulate
No need to personally experience everything.. In this era.. You can use so many feeds like virtual clues from youtube, audios etc.. You can exactly capture how it feel.. In old times, personally experience a thing is needed bcoz you don't have properly shaped clues on how it feels.. But now we have so much info, we don't need it to personally own to feel it.. We can feel it in mind using the clues gathered through internet, so many books etc.. 
[14/01, 2:11 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Many hobbies.. You can't fulfill either bcoz some are costly and some needs time..
[14/01, 2:12 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): But, see a detailed youtube video, Google images, you can simulate the exact personalised feel of it in your mind.. You can play it in your mind.. And about new inputs, your subconscious mind will make it real.. By pulling more clues from unknown ways..
[14/01, 2:12 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): In past times, this is not possible bcoz there was no internet, no Google, no youtube, no so many digital pics, no so many books etc
Daydreaming, Lucid dreaming, virtual reality, video games etc etc.. So many ways to fulfill your desires which you may not either find time or money.. And even if you make loa work to manifest them.. You'll still not be able to enjoy them bcoz of so many amount of cool desires. So, why not just about some of them via things like daydreaming, wild imagination, Lucid dreaming, gaming etc
[14/01, 2:20 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Why we give so much priority to only one form of reality
[14/01, 2:21 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): You can experience so many things via other realities..
Imagine being able to not only fulfill quickly, but enjoy multiple desires in less amount of time. In that image randomiser, imagine fulfilling all desires within 1 hr only.. A super packed fun hour n not a fun but dragged hour.. You'll filled with so much fun anticipation in that hour. 
This I think is same as.. A future which is not letting you be bored
Quickly quickly taking essence of all
This is maybe how billionaires enjoy
Even if you can't fulfill some of your desires, atleast be happy to have a rosy pictures of them in your mind
[16/12, 7:14 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): *Even if you can't fulfill some of your desires, atleast be happy to have a rosy pictures of them in your mind. Sometimes desires or the image of them are better then what they will be in actuality. Maybe that's why sometimes they don't get fulfilled. Bcoz you may not like them or they may not as expectations*
[16/12, 7:16 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Sometimes it's good to only have desires of some things
Sometimes it's good to only be happy in a trailers, bcoz you may not like the full movie
[16/12, 7:17 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Sometimes it's good to be content in just their smiles
[16/12, 7:17 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Sometimes ads are better then the real products
[16/12, 7:19 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): To experience something in detail usually ruins the mysteriousness of it
[16/12, 7:20 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): That's why many marriages fail or become loveless or just an agreement or adjustance when once they were pure spontaneous love
[16/12, 7:21 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): That's why, sometimes, previews, teasers and unfulfilled wishes are great sometimes
[16/12, 7:21 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): But just don't let them in your mind as resentful
As if you can experience anything what anyone had/is experience in the world, also things they haven't. All positive
Do you want to waste time in emulating it in real world when you can do it in imagination or.. with vividness

How to find time to enjoy all desires -
Immortal
Longevity
Rebirth with awareness
Micro dozing
[18/01, 5:02 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Death is a great waster.. It wastes so many intelligent people and skills..
[18/01, 5:03 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Death is a disease and it shouldn't be glorified
[18/01, 5:03 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): A person have the potential to grow into more and more beauty but death steal all
Early death 
Don't be greedy for life
Prepare for a best deliberate, conscious and happy and choice death, rather than..
Well, death will come for sure ." i want to die prepared, not unprepared"
Life is to die in style
Why should i live - 
- to enjoy life , life is or can be beautiful or solved
- bcoz maybe living it adds something permanent to me 
- bcoz what else
- bcoz have to live
- bcoz i Don't know how to die instantly n  permanently and i maybe need time to find how
- bcoz some ppl love me or depended on me
Don't live as if you have your full life left but how much your cool life left, how much healthy life left, how much with family left, how much life of eyes left, how much opportunity left 
Alternative ways to be immortal -

Multitasking means smart switching between tasks again and again, not..
Multitasking to your potential
Kai Saare kaam khina lo
Interesting multitasking
Best use of time
Workholic , Be busy
Why otherly
The jest to do multitasking will give you energy , It makes you proactive , It makes your brain fast, it makes you think fast
Multitasking signifies balance between all desires
Past will automatically get used in Multitasking
Successful people just do things , Just do it , This is the concept of just do karmas on and on
Multitask, this dt itself is a lot of Multitasking. Dt is multitasking in nature and that's why it is the real deep actual technique
Multitasking reduces my addictions bcoz i'm interested in doing so many things and i dont feel bad in not doing it like pubg game bcoz i know that i will get back to it too eventually. Multitasking will help you stop things way before time bcoz you have other things to do too, like, in case of, addictions like fapping etc
Multitasking is making things done at a very fast rate
Multitasking at home
What multitasking to do in park - girls, connect, call,..
Multitasking in money
Find opportunities and times to multitask
Group tasks which you can multitask with each other
Don't be just sad or depressed, do it with other things, multitasking
When you are having carbs but less , you are doing multitasking , by having taste and by having care of your health
You don’t like when you have to give dedicated time to a desire bcoz there are other desires , and also you are worried that will it give results worth the time n effort, that’s why don’t do it separately but alongwith other desires.
Its like multiple tasks/results in one effort/time
Cashing multiple things simultaneosuly

Desire doesn't stay long , but the procrastination of it , the knowledge that you are prepared for such cool desire , that you can easily make it happen
Fun of knowledge of exciting evening or tomorrow or weekend etc
Also for which you are sure that you are prepared
And not overwhelm and rest things managed and no tensions
Why did I discard monthly tech , and de group it by timing -
Bcoz I mistakenly think it is main tech whereas ways and cool lists is main tech
Bcoz it is based on monthly , not daily or weekend ..
..
This helps loa bcoz you expect sex and ld at night
This doc excites me instantly
It's not about past but future. It's not about what goes but what will come. Unless you want to enjoy memories which you will enjoy too in future

It is helpful for loa too
This will make you alive
You can say that you've have lived your life in all ways
Cluster tech] Y live -
Bcoz
Bcoz i can have this type of session everyday
Daily have a session/cluster for fulfilment
Those techniques in Zorba doc
They are not particular desires
Particular desires don't fulfill us that much, then the ways we do those particular desires.. Like binge,.. Etc
So, everyday do your desires/tasks /efforts in such meta desirey ways
One hour is enough or three times a day to be mindfully satisfied and content all day
It is not the replacement for  other desires, but it will help you to not expect happiness from everything and doing only things tasks and desires that make you happy but all tasks desires etc which don't make you feel good now but necessary
Do a session of feeling productive.. That will help you over all day
Types of clusters daily - 
- Sessions for future  - Habits (by health, money etc)
- Sessions for present - like productivity,  mindmagic, meditations, that daily feel cluster, etc
Everyday, do things for present and for future. And not just for one otherwise the imbalance will make you sad
And make a session as rich with quality, quantity and variety otherwise you'll not feel satisfied
You do sessions for future, not bcoz they will give you satisfaction etc but bcoz they are necessary to maintain life and for giving side happinesses. Main satisfaction will always come from the present sessions. And live life bcoz you get to do these present sessions everyday from today to future
I'll do the daily clusters in the satisfaction of present clusters, just as tasks etc maybe.  Live not for future clusters but for the present clusters in future
You just don't like the feeling of being unproductive or not being productive or productive in right or full way bcoz you feel that you are not doing or doing enough to get to your full potential and you shouldn't fake this too bcoz deep down you will know that you are faking.  It's not about rewards and what rewards.. Its about that are you doing something and enough to get to your fullest potential.  These things help feel that - clustering technique,  multitasking, logs,  writing points n ideas, contemplation,  prioritizing, less of not doing anything, being busy, managing onenote, getting multiple results simultaneously, regular habits of all areas,  reading books,  finding new productivity techniques,
This is the reason of pain and sadness in life
It doesn't matter for what and how.. Matter is that you should be feeling that you are doing everything and best of your efforts for the potential
Sad that doing nothing or enough for desires, potential, tensions, tasks, etc
Not doing anything, not doing enough, not doing properly,..
That y not fulfilling existing desires, and if no existing desires, then y not finding new desires
Fulfill those desires first or maybe only those which help you get productive and more n more productive. You want to be productive for whatever desires you have and whatever you will get.
You want to be productive.. That's your biggest and only main desire. And you love everything that helps you in that. To create interest in something, associate or find how and how much it can help you in being n more productive.

Very imp) How to make a day different
25-Oct-17
3:21
Why ?
Bcoz only those days count which are different from other routine regular monotonous repetitive days
Bcoz only such make life interesting and good when seen back or as memories
Bcoz such make life boring n repetitive
Bcoz changes etc will show contrasts etc , the spice , bcoz days are the canvas of time
Desires are nothing but just an excuse to change old schedule
This is called as enjoying little little happiness
That's why there are no universal desires , a bald man gets bored with baldness n want hair n a haired man gets bored with hair and gets near bald haircut , also that's why workers at tajmahal could get bored there bcoz same everyday. That's why people get bored with girls they had loved , money they had earned. Etc
I m feared that is there any limit to desires , but there is , upto until a day feels diffrent than rest of days. This is the criteria.
That's why porn attracts bcoz different Novelty
That's why changing lights locations and moving furnitures feels good
Almost all days feel like groundhog day
What to do ?
Either do different things or do things differently
Find out repetitive things n
remove or didn't do/see
alter (do/see them differently) or
replace them with different things
Have a log of such days , only those days count
Do/see
Actions , sights , sounds , smells , touches , tastes ,..
Repetitive things i do these days almost daily -
Place , Shop ) - , tension , Contemplation ,
Place , House ) - , blame , program , roaming ,
Place , online ) - ,
Place , market ) - ,
This is the biggest and Basic desire
Meta - it is when you do the solutions too ..
Also same places
Notice how it is different from other days
Also write what regular it replace
Well , if your past days is riddled with fapping , then nofapping will sure different your days , but it doesn't mean that soon it will be like same , you can different it too without needing to go back , there are stages in this.
Sipping tea in back of shop

To motivate , see how much will it change or differentiate days
Focus on making your tomorrow different then today
Some things are always different each time , like sunning ,or cigarette , that breaking bad s3e11
Focus on not different , but not repetitive

Sort by amount
Solve them
Stop escapism or covering up or immerse in other
At shop/home/..
It helps finding/uncovering true desires
============
Idea tech
Things I like n don't n could like/don't
At places
Types of things
Variety in that type
Necessary and timepass
Create/modify/embrace/use/combine/imagine/visualise
Physical/metaphysical/living/big/small/digital/..
Enjoy life via enjoy things . Bcoz they are same. things are ideas manifested. Enjoy the idea behind.
Magical sounds/visuals/.. 
Magicalish
Magical things/world
If not magical , make it magical
Convert problems/resistances to..
Convert steps/substeps to.. 
Find/create/convert/see/..
Ld -  magical world 
Loa -  magical living world 
It's like magical 
Problems solve in magical way, convert them to magical 
Why this format - bcoz the process of finding a tech is also the same format of problem-solution format 
Main thing is to be excited, magical is to be excited 
Ideas and excitement are byproduct of ..
Have lists
Schedule week
Think in term of things
Enjoy the thing registeringly
Don't enjoy two things simultaneously otherwise you cannot enjoy even one properly
Just list/realize things and they will fulfill automatically. Iykwim
Not activities bcoz..
I love ideas coming and ideas. So , work for..
Ideas fulfill automatically
Ideas means you are connected to universe
Ideas I m living for :
Placeswise , and ideas Acc to priority from necessary(survival/problems) to timepass
Places - workplace , home , market , everywhere , body , world , vehicle , mind ,..
money , family , health , med shop , confidence , stunts , arts  , ideas ,..
List will increase with time
Common/particular
sort by amount of exciting/newness
Ideas and their execution/implementation and their rewarding/resulting is fun
Not old thoughts/ideas but new , type of..
I like topics that I think which ignites ideas or hv probability of ideas
Which hv variety
Gadgets , porn - I love see new ideas through them
Ideas behind diff diff music
That's why internet is fun , bcoz ideas directly visible or behind
Songs/dance/arts/drawings have ideas behind them
That's why ld's are interesting
I like that which make me think easily , clearly and.. For new and more ideas
I like that which helps/enables/opens up me thinking ideas and new and more and diff and I dislike that..
Knowledge , untethered soul etc gives ideas
Overwhelment
Don't see future as certain
Manage old ideas otherwise new won't come
Remove the resistances
Visualisation helps , those visualisation techs.
Sort things by amount of ideas and scope/sky they give me in case of thinking new etc
Is loa contradictory to ideas
Maybe ideas fulfill automatically if new and exciting
Ideas as steps and substeps is loa way maybe
Idea is vibration , excitement , energy , and automatically fulfillable by themselves
Curiosity ? Creativity ? Excitement ?
How I get this tech? From that previous tech ?
Path is the way/target
Make your mundane things interesting again
Ideas excites in life
Make life exciting
Exciting ,
Ideas make soul alive , they give purpose/meaning to life , is vibrations
That's why new new tech after 3-4 days
That's why scientists are so immersed and not sad bcoz ideas , Make them forget food , is evolution,..
It's what drives people , make them wake late , make their eyes shine , shine in eyes
It is creativity
Creativity
It is biggest religion ever , it is bcoz it is tpt in itself
They make you men , alive , not robot
Ideas never die
Solution of depression
Ideas is the nishani of healthy and great and working mind
Ideas reflect that their is potential for something
This is dreaming
Idea is salt of life
Everything is idea ,I m too
DT is all ideas
Ideas means new thought maybe
Ideas is always new thought
Steps and substeps are also ideas
Desires are also ideas
Wishful imagination
Visualise yourself too along..
Tpt , Meta
Feeling
Live not for interesting life or interesting surroundings or outside life in future.. Live for interesting mind
For outside world can never be in your control but inner world can
Live to make your mind more n more interesting/beautiful
One with high productivity, interesting effective alter egos,  intresting inter reactions,
It doesn't mean to denounce or don't work for awesome external things and facilities and luxuries.. It just mean to not see meaning or goal in them.
Mind hai toh sab kuch hai
Good mind with highly effective strategies for universe
One day I'll have highly imaginative mind, highly creative, highly intuitive, highly focused,..
Create a log of what what changes in mind every month/year
Mind with awesome beliefs
Mind with good habits
For highly rich inner world
If your life/outside is boring, make your mind interesting. Bcoz your mind will always be with you.  Do these in mind - 
loa contemplations
swag imaginations
dance
paintings
wild imaginations
revenge fantasies
interesting comebacks
fan fiction
random observations
ideal body
Futurology
sexual imaginations
imaginations of solving problems majestically
nostalgia
rethink funny situations in past n present
reactions
rephrasings
imaginary cars, ghosts,.. Etc (see the list from that multireddit)
conspiracies
romance
ideal world
guessings/assumings
girl dancing or you dancing with girl
meditations
poems
Retrospections, reflecting back, gratitude
-..
Note - thinking for solutions for sadness and thinking for happiness is nothing but your mind trying to be interesting via that
That's why children are happy. They are properly into their mind.
You can't change outside but can always your mind.
Emotional people can emotionally use their mind.. Like wild imaginations
You use your mind to make yourself happy for future but not for present. For ex, to think of ideas for seduction only to write them to use them in future for future happiness. Its not anything bad in it but you should also use your mind for present too.
That's why kids are always happy and curious
You always have things easily manifested in your mind
Mostly you use your mind for finding solutions and not for the fun of using your mind
Mind/subconscious is nothing but universe... Where do you think ideas come from
Mental diet maybe?
Maybe this will make you a dreamer
This is living in present
Using mind for present is being connected to yourself and the source
It will make you alive
This is that.. That happiness is within ourselves
This will give you motivation bcoz now you know that you can always manage to make your life interesting.. Even without any external aid
Bcoz you feel your mind is nothing and not fun without some external aid
You can enjoy and not get lonely in jail too
You will not get lonely
It's not just mental but emotional too
Places experience 
29-Mar-19
21:28
Y this tech was ditched before?
Bcoz introvert and extrovert places is vague
Places I'm mostly at these days - 
bed, bedroom, pc
House other rooms, bathroom
Park, gym
Bike
Market
D park
New potential places
Mdu
Outside general
Inside general
Other interesting places I should be n improve too -
Car
Workplace /office
..
Maybe group/sort by time most spend there or place categories
It's easy to imagine too if places..
The phrase.. He is going places
You get ideas acc to places too
No need to further categorise tasks accordingly.. Just add +1 after doing to the place
Even if the batch results technique is considered, you can enjoy the batch results at a particular place only
Be at peace whereever u r
Maybe work for best introvert experience
Create log of what what you did to improve your introvert experience every month
Y not extrovert experience
A cave for laziness and doing nothing and just being by yourself
Weed
Minimalism
Girls suck and very demanding
Go extrovert only to maintain this introvert experience
Extroverts are introverts who can be introvert with other people.. Who can share their introvert experience with other people
Living by intj (introvert goals) 
Your nature
Tasks accordingly
Hobbies and desires accordingly
Big fun office room personal with only two three main supervisor which you manage and which are Mbti Compatible to you..
Only talk with supervisors
Full freedom to take all decisions like buying etc
Lots of enfps and compatible Mbti like vaibhav
In that office - aquarium, pc setup, library, cozy, fireplace, Sunlight,..
Fucking intj, enfp etc there.. Like secretary..
Big screen for porn n games
Delegating tasks to ppl
With loa working
Anything that helps you in being yourself which is intj
Introvert and extrovert experience
Whereever u r , make it heaven 
introvert and extrovert goals
Overall introvert experience
Just like everything can be draped into nationalism, you can drape experiences into introvert extrovert too
Make the experience of introvertness intense n better n same with extrovert 
Can this be the essence for life effort or main target for life
Overall
How your introvert experience have improved
How can introvert experience be more improved
How your extrovert experience have improved
How your extrovert experience be more improved
Y introvert extrovert etc
Bcoz clear distinction
Me and others time
Money earning n enjoying
Ppl n privacy
Multiple places n one fixed place
Bcoz overall picture
Bcoz experiences that takes place at home n outside are very different from each other and alike in themselves
Bcoz you basically an introvert and it's your base
In is rest, out is effort
Different kind of thinking in in n different in out
In n out are totally different structurewise
You can make both highly different from each other.. So that they will not look alike.. This way you can have two corners to swing to and fro n you then can't get bored at all
You don't want to mix things of out in in and in in out
Bcoz you seriously hate people barging into your house
Bcoz you can divide all desires n goals into only 2 which is inside n outside. N dividing is necessary for taste of choice.
Dividing into inside n outside creates choice
That's why they say one is going places
Basically you are either inside or outside.. So, do things to improve experience you can have inside or outside. You have all experiences either inside or outside.
You spend your life either mostly inside n outside
Improving the introvert experience improves all the experience you will have in in. Same with extrovert
That's why they say to not bring office to home n home to office
When at home, be fully at home
What about work place - make it like home
Basically introvert is one fixed place
You can have multiple places for introvert, like home, workplace, family house, farm house, another house, etc
Temporary introvert places
Maybe there is no extrovert places but temporary introvert places
Common in introvert places - Lens,..
Temporary or short duration introvert places these days - swimmingpool , park, Gym, Mdu
Permanent or long duration introvert places these days - house, workplace, shop,
You worked good to enjoy swimming pool too
This will help you stay in present bcoz you are working to enjoy the place you are in
This will help you visualise n draw a clear picture of what you want
It will help you be at one place n not anxious to be in another
Reminiscence experience
Philosophy - reflecting back , respecting your efforts and results, kinda like gratitude , ego worthy etc
Things you couldn't have thought five years ago

Creations/manifestations journal
Mine and others , also find why your subconscious was directly curious in it ,
Also write previous loa.. Here too from other docs
Everything little or big is manifested by me somehow
Those manifestations which you are not sure of , prefix them as 'maybe'
Sometimes your life have so many synchronicities/manifestations that's it's hard to find them like fish in water can't feel the abundance which is water , when life feels easy or in flow , consider that there are many manifestations happening.
By learning from experiences , they mean studying manifestations journal and understanding..
The way it get answered , similar or learn or ..
I noticed most people use - 'isn't it would be nice if that happens' type of line
Author:automoderator in search of loa subreddit
Sort these by categories (ppl, foods etc) and each category with amount of probability
Divide into groups - ppl, foods, songs, situations etc
Also intentional or not
Spread these with others
Intuitions
Manifestations on others maybe
Type of synchronicities :
Loa is the solution for everything, it's how the universe born and continuing and how u born. It's the solution for eternity or permanent death, whatever u may choose. Also stubborn health problems like eye vision etc
Broadcast ownership of it, not lackingship
Not objects but feelings.
To enjoy it purely

Imp] [m-log] Loa - Good memories log
Wednesday, August 12, 2015
2:53 PM
Relevant docs - Loa logs
=============================================
Very imp  - This doc is a nice way to put one in present 
Very imp - Desire is to find and enjoy those unique delicacies/comforts/pleasures/luxuries of it with your soul taste buds in a creating memories sort of way 
Highlighting good memories than bad helps in happiness and motivation and helps in more such memories on principle of Loa
After I meditate I have a good feeling that can be compared to feeling nostalgic for something. But instead of feeling nostalgic of something in the past, I feel it for what's happening right now.
Maybe This is like creating and memorizing good dreams in a lucid dream.  Memorizing so as to recall later and creating so as to enjoy.
How to create good memories :
Save/memorise/highlight/keep/savour/Set/live/see these :
Detect first time things ,it , this moment ,Even small small moments, things, gestures
As : 
memorable
Live it as if it is very positive to be a memorable
as soon to be a good memory
as a future good memory
as if this is a nice memory in-building/on-progress
as a great/nice/fine/mildly -interesting future memory which will prove to be nice possession to have.
as something you are earning as some nice possession to be proud of in future as a great memory
Live life working to collect or create as much good memories as possible , Work each day to create memorable memories
End it in good way , Convert it to memorable
It is a good memory in itself,  no need to count the mood in which you did it,  no need to count the other bad memories surrounding it, no need to count all aspects of it to be good for example in Park , memory of park greeneryness is good but not of mosquito biting . So highlight the good aspect of park as memory.

Doc - list of things I tried and found that I liked
Doc - unexpected unpredictable things
Live for unexpected unpredictable things
Not predictable or expected even how good they are
This is the best motivation
Probability of unexpected things in an area ex girls
This is loa too bcoz you intent for unexpected goodness
Don't try to imagine unexpected
Maybe a thing is expected but not the amount , amount is unexpected.
It means that you can get awesome things in life which you cannot imagine in present
regarding girls - so many are liking me , that In park ask for time , that on station ask for metro , that In vaishno click my pics , amount of girls in vaishno , that doctor in max synchronicities and high interest , that girl in metro is ignoring her tall jaat bf for me , that girl in vaishno train , that married villager woman in metro , muskan two times in market , ..

Improvements which are in danger
List of magical/drastic improvements
Improvements you are proud of
Not additions but improvements
Kind of better alternative wrt previous

Right way to gratitude
Loa - imagine yourself having a car and seeing/enjoying it as improvement
Relatively
Monthly or not
Maybe create a list in each section
Tarakki
That point (loa, Onenote etc)
Not repair etc
Interesting improvements 
Just improve laziness
automation
fighting entropy
making things less bad , difficult ,..
I am lazy and demotivated .Maybe that's the power.
For this luxury of laziness
Why improving things when one thing could ruin everything
Toilet from public toilet
Sofas from only plastic chairs
Less fat from high fat
Voice
Custom rom
OneNote mobile
Strikethrough
Swype typing from..
OneNote from text
Memorisation techniques

Improvements which impacted/improved my life n mood greatly , and happiness
Improvements you didn't knew that they will be so amazing
memories tech
choicefulness
To motivate yourself for it , don't take tension of it ,ex, goobi marriage
Improvement - it will feel like improvement when.., that point
Maybe sort by..
Dt helps in improvements
What about reversals
Dhuandhaar improvements , here and there
Buy goobi newspaper
just go hell bent on improving things and logging of improvements
profitable improvements
whats your standards of improvement , kab lagega ki improvement ho gai
maybe things u want to improve
What about single failure , like something is better then nothing.
Dt , how you use it to justify you..
Why my mind give me epiphanies etc only in emergencies or when I m way down
Visualise yourself happy but still proudly greedy
Don't internalize problems
also group by powers in pc

Loa) maybe) unexpected things today
Unexpected and good
Unexpectedly unexpected
Recent previous unexpected
Remember the breakings of expected
Maybe count only good ones, delete bad ones
Maybe notice recent previous continuous cooler air goodness , and see how unnoticed it has been this goodness. Or how hard it is to notice or imagine before. 
And be that if that, than don't know how many in current moment i couldn't notice

Cool results you can achieve in a day
Essence
such less time for a thing with results of such big time
inc time if needed to make it look small
Maybe main idea is consolidation
Write in days and weeks , not in ..
As less times as possible , it shouldn't feel too many times
Also write how many days it overflow from estimated, so that it later improves your estimating skills regarding it.
Only a day , not weeks etc bcoz this will unnecessarily extend it
Sort by days
What about regular/big  desires/tasks
only in day
Partial
Start
Maybe divide a big task into days and name the days ,ex , finding car , contacting , buying , licensing , etc
What about one day tasks
Group in that doc , desires which you can finish in one day
List of things I completed in time , that is one day
Group Taskss too this way , by days or not
Doc - tasks i can finish today/one-day
Doc - that desires lists
What about many number of such one day tasks
set or single
If too many entries of single single day
What abt Grouping hygiene tasks like brushing , eyes , etc
What about one day but regular tasks
_________________________
Gf - 1 day ,
Car - 1 week ,
Meds - 1 week , one ws in a day
Swimming - 1 day
Eyes exercises - if 10 min daily , it mean 300 min in month , which is 5 hour per month , which is only 3 days per year.
Desire of driving , maybe not possible now , but can be completed in just one day when it become possible. To get a car is also a separate desire which can too be divided into days
Multivitamins , daily it takes 2 min 3 times , which is 6 min. Which is 180 mins which is 3 hrs per month , which is 36 hrs per year
foods log - 1 day
eyes 2 times 10 min per day
only 6 days
one day , one week , one month , one year , regularly maybe
Maybe - give or take this much time
assigning days make it believable and achievable and thus desirable
When you know what you can achieve within just one day , you will get motivated
Its not that i don't like desires , it's just that the vagueness of how soon they will be achieved make me uninterested.
It also helps in loa
highly motivational
Suppose if you cannot do a regular task on a day , (and not to get disappointed) see it as just 6 min less in that 3 days. And if you do (and not to ego), see it as just 6 min in that 3 days. And if you fear/lazy , see it as just 3 days of year
To stop a bad habit , see how much days it take from year ,ex , fapping per month i do  is average these days is 9 and each take 4-5 hours which is 45 hrs per month which is 2 days per month which is 24 days per year. Note - also count Hangover from fap
sleep , 9-10 hours per day , 300 hrs per month , which is 12-13 days per month which is 144 days per year
Digitalisation , suppose digitalise 50 pages per month which takes 2-3 hrs by swype and voice typing which is 36 hrs per year which is 1.5 day  per year only.
You do 12 hrs mobile and pc daily , which is 180 days per year
Why this tech is superior , and THE tech , and better and inclusive of other techs
Group dt using this tech
Projects/tasks/desires
results which you can get in a day
Regular things which will take this much days in a year
Meditation - 1/2 hr -
Meditation - 10 min -
Hygiene (brush, meds, bath ,
Note -should we create a collective group like this hygiene group bcoz it might shows the days in increased manner. Maybe use this tech only for that and when you lazy in a particular
Rest/laziness you do in a day , and you do this much days in a year -
Tech based on powers is a good tech . This tech is based on time power.
Mobile addiction -
Revenge , how many days of ashoki bhajan ,..
Things you like - they can be done in a day. So, do all that
Things you don't like - they need to be done for only this much days of time in a year, so, do them

Things that I remember that I enjoyed
6-Nov-18
19:03
Recently
Today
That i remember that I enjoyed
Only of today or that which you remember that you've enjoyed
How to memorise that you've enjoyed it
Delete old entries, older then one day
Write this list daily
That you've actually enjoyed
You feel that you are sad today or haven't enjoyed lately, n to break it, you need to find goodness within that time or of that time.. 
Strong memory..
Merge with doc, excel,.., checkbox..
============================
Kheera, Chocolate, Buttery roti with achaar, tea, Akhrot, sonpapdi
Chat with bindu
Movie
50k in atm
Be happy, relax and celebrate that the things that didn't let you enjoy your life bcoz of their tension didn't happened today too. Things like.. -  untolerable poverty, homelessness, obesity, total desperation,  total confusion,  total choicelessness,  bike theft, burglary, chedchad, public beating, eyesight, 
From all departments

Aaj toh nahi hai na
Life is already good.. It's just tensions don't let us enjoy.. No matter how many and however quality techniques you find
Primitive ancient people use to live like this and that's why they were satisfied. For it is simple.
Live life this way.. Reclaim your life,  enjoy that today too got untouched by them. This way you passively enjoy all the happinesses of the day that previously you couldn't bcoz of tension
That law.. Murphy
Suffering book..
Note - only write the genuine tensions that eat and bugs you.. Dont write by imagination. And sort by how much bugs you
Live for day
This is living in present
This energizes you and make you confident, and when you feel untouchable.. You want to accomplish things for there is nothing to affect the results
Life can never be fully perfect and living for chasing a perfect life is stupid and tiring. Infact, learn to enjoy that life is not fully imperfect.
Them don't let you breath peacefully otherwise even breath is very fulfilling itself.
Now you don't ambition for things bcoz.. But bcoz..
This makes you contented that you've maintained it
That's why rich people are sad sometimes and poor are happy for poor have nothing to lose whereas rich have tensions of becoming poor. If only rich live by this technique, he can be carelessly happy like poor and still have awesome Choicefulness
Don't be sad that life is not totally perfect.. Be happy that life is not totally imperfect
This simple technique don't come in people mind bcoz they don't want to even notice unpleasant things less attest want to accept that they suffers from them
Be happy that not in this hour
What we say to death - not today
Usually when you are achieving things, these mishappenings demotivate and stops you.. So, when they are not happening, you should be feel motivated and not to be demotivated
Today I'm lucky
Things I m enjoying/using/cashing these days bcoz of past efforts
This doc will motivate you to do efforts for new things
Don't list those things here which you get without effort, not that they are wrong, but main target is to make you effort for new things for which you don't want to do effort
.. Bcoz of efforts i did for them
Increase this list
Things which will help me keeping away from sadness for many days 
Which drastically/dramatically changed my current daily life
Maybe sort by efforts or how much enjoy /use /..  Or by recent effort
For which i did efforts "recently"
Note - sort by duration of sadness they prevent
Note - subgroup by amount of time i used to had to embrace before.. Like years with hdd when no ssd

Don't let negative thoughts/highlights become memories but positive..  Good memories is real possession (improvise and share this article). Tomorrow you will proud and satisfy of your good memories, not what money etc you earned but how you earned 
I want to create those memories with it
Nostalgia
See how good it as memory,  the rareness, the satisfaction, the..
Selective memory instead of overall memory
Memory good selective
Memory - selective. Ignore bad as memories
Very imp - all desires are of memories. Work for them. Possessions to work for.
Memory tech - it puts you in present as best as possible
Memory - first time
Desire - memories - maybe all desires comes under memories
All desires come under memories maybe
Maybe all desires are of memory
Desires -  work/live/aim for great memories.  Iykwim
Desires -  memories,
Good memory
Celebrate loa moments n good moments in a memory creating way
What happens after death?
Anyone know?
Do we fookin reboot?
Or what
Bcoz I want to be immortal
That's the only way to feel like doing so many efforts
It feels stupid to do efforts for such a small life
I'm deep into loa
But i know one lifetime is not enough to reap full benefits of it
Life is so fuckin beautiful
So much potential
So much potential of potential
Everything is in mind
There is nothing but just one big mind
One big consciousness
We are thoughts
Of that big consciousness
Made of same consciousness matter
Like little little ice cubes in water
We are water too but little bit shaped and consolidated
Create choices
A future full of choices
Smart and quality choices, not ugly choices
Create atleast 3-4 good choices/alternatives 4 everything
For ex, being fit will create multiple choices.. Like you now have option to try girls, jogging, swag, etc..
Having your own house gives you choice to have your own space, and sometimes live with parents, to have girls at your house etc.
You are ok without these choices too but life will be more cool with them.
There is a freedom in choices
Like don't you want to not stuck with no option to travel bcoz No money to have money to travel to have enough money to travel anywhere you want like Paris, Goa etc.. Choices like that
Where is the previous doc
Create a log of.. In what what i now have choiceful in.., simple logging like.. I now have a bike is boring.. But when you write that now you have choicefulness between bike, activa, auto, on feet.. You feel achievement and freedom and proud.
Like Choicefulness between doing dt in desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, two mobiles etc
Recent choicefulnesses I got -  bike activa walk auto, pc laptop upgrade, ssd hdd,  new and old Baniyan,  sector park or mansarovar,  to upgrade pc or not, etc
Glasses, Lens
Sennheiser, ubon
New clothes vs old
Jeans, pants
Syncme, webdav
Workplace, home
Multiple cozy positions
Introvert experience, extrovert experience
Normal typing, swype typing, voice typing,..
Live for finding other good alternatives
Its not enough good that multiple alternatives, good is that all alternatives have their own goodness and qualities and fun.
Vaise bhi, new desires come and inspired from old and already fulfilled desires
Rich aren't those who have quantity in things but who have quality quantity in alternatives
Games are addictive bcoz so many simultaneous good choices
Also be happy that both or all choices are so different to each other.. Like bike have its own fun, activa its own, auto its own etc
A thing also gets interesting when there is alternative good choices to it
While kissing a girl, notice how many different opportunities you have "simultaneously" to enjoy her body.. Like you can either kiss her or bite the nipple or.. Etc etc

Standard life checklist 
9-Dec-18
2:51
Live a normal stereotyped standard life which most humanity live.. Bcoz living it is like living a normal human life.. Which should be too
We all live following each other
Kids
Marriage
Job
Car
House
Love
Wife
Column - common standard in society
I want life should be -  
Life is a story n story should be -
grand/royal , 
examplory, 
smart , 
twisty , 
giving , 
feelgood , 
Independent 
? Financially :
? House :
? Live in rented house
? Drop yourself from his money - plot etc
? Cooking -
? I can make egg dishes , tea
? Washing - I can use machines
? Can use bai
? Can use local services
? I can wash my clothes
Surity [
When luck is not helping and efforts are not resulting and no opportunities
When health is not helping..
Bcoz health will help wealth, wealth will help health etc
Compound effect
Imagine you getting results from everywhere
Imagine a future where low efforts are giving big results
As if you get good opportunities again n again to try efforts
How it feels if it comes to know that you've finished all the efforts for it
See that x tech
Nehru place
Easy and difficult again and again
As if you get good opportunities again n again to try efforts
And maybe you are confident about the quality of the efforts
.. To try your good quality efforts
Or opportunities where even your bad qualities efforts can work
Is this gambling
Like interactive gaming rather then movie
What if those things are or becomes easy -
Job
People
Python
..
Things that happened automatically n effortlessly today -
Bathing
Future where these things happen automatically -
Things I finished today -
Note - why - bcoz you will know now that you can take your efforts to fulfillation
Get out of your comfort zone
Bill gates was already rich. His dad was already influential in his locality, he could have just enjoyed with what he had but he efforted in his passions, he worked on computers.
Look at him today. Enjoying his billions and also help changing the world and funding many interesting projects
Elon musk have been bald at once, and is like an average IT  engineer. But he efforted in his passions.
Look at him today. Electric self driving cars, rockets and shit
?? Look at me.. I could have easily enjoyed chanting those religious mantras i was raised with in a conservative house , but I read multiple philosophies, religions and ended (at the moment) with lots of synchronicities and Epiphanies. Fingers of both hands and legs crossed for future ??
How to enjoy your failed efforts -
Count number of failed efforts
Count the hours efforting
Find difficulty.. Do things the difficult way
You don't want to do this effort bcoz you can't see it working for that result or bcoz you don't think it is effort for that desire -
But wealth helps health etc
It will keep you active
Discipline
Flow
Result from this effort will help in effort or result of that desire
Note - usually results are what make us to do efforts, or not, the desire to do effort is based on the fun factor of result. But, the comparison of results makes us see some efforts as less good then other efforts. We see effort for a lambhorghini as good effort then effort for a Mercedes. And this makes us lazy and procrastinate and hate efforts.
Stop discriminating between efforts
This will make you respect all efforts n you'll will equally excited for all and any efforts
..
keep efforting even if results are meh bcoz -
exponential
keep efforting even if results not showing bcoz -
results are being accumulated
near to completion
hideous and behind the scenes
subtle
Gamble your efforts with low chance of results
Do efforts, result is gamble
A life where you efforted daily for the betterment of future for only 1 hr is significantly less better than a life where you worked 2 hrs
no matter what , we do efforts daily deliberately or forcedly[job] for the betterment of future/present/life either 2 hr or 1 hr , but wouldn't a month with days where you efforted 5 hrs for the betterment will make a good relatively better future then a month with days with only efforting for 2 hrs.
if not better then atleast less worse
think abt it , if you have done only half of the efforts you did in past , your life would be half better then what it currently is
and yes , i m talking abt smart efforting , not mindless unplanned efforts
What if you don't effort -
Suicide is not an option
Slowly what you have will get lost
You'll have to effort later if not now
You'll get more n more lazy
More bad habits
Note - it's not about why to do efforts, you always have something to effort for even if you don't find that much meaning in it , it's about what if you don't.. 
..
Other possible benefits of efforting for it -
Compound effect
Butterfly effect
Good sideeffects
The more you effort, the more you don't need to effort
Check since when you are doing these -
Keto
Loa
Dt
Shireen
Whatsapp groups
Nehal
Since How long i'm efforting for these things -
Keto
Loa
..
Why , so that i dont give up life easily
Adjusting with these things since How long -
Eyes
.
There is opposite of everything in this world , Imagine how would it feel to feel the opposite of this boredom and depression you are feeling , opposite of this lowliness and this negativeness.
There must be that feeling in world
Live for that

Batch results 
Tuesday, March 26, 2019
8:57 AM
Enjoy 10..in batch.. Instead of
Set such that ten things result simultaneously.. Delay the results somehow.. Finish them near to result n then finish all ten such that they result simultaneously
You like results.. But not like when they are separate from each other so much
Bingeing on one is fun but it feels like you stuck to only one
Like rain of results
Group tasks..
This way you can control your happiness n still be happy
Instead of all days as averagely happy day, make few days as special memorable awesome days n you can still be happy in anticipation of them
But make it such that its fail proof n that some result may not go bad otherwise it will ruin the fun of all
What about little little happiness
Visualise things resulting simultaneously in one day
Dividend
Small and big day
Result such that first time result
What about doing 2 min tasks immediately
preparations
Nofap for now, use energy for heavy exercise n girls on Sunday
Keto for now.., use good clothes to cash keto on..
Respect your result bcoz of the efforts
It helps in rewards system
this way u can control your happiness timing n amount..
Parties
Regular
Not Sunday, but column, hold, n when multiple entries get holded, mark the ones you can cash in weekend or particular one day
Column - how to preserve/hold
Columns - cashed or not, how much cashed?
Imagine a future in which you are/have-become good at these things - 
Imagine how cool it is to be good in those things.. How useful.. How satisfying..
All those things are interesting in which there is potential to improve
Getting good is the journey
Learning
Maybe create a excel chart of each progress.. With somehow good way to log
Good, knowledgeable
But I've wrote this tech before.. Whats the difference now
Things in which you remember you were not good before - typing, rechecking, ocd, loa, keto,..
It doesn't mean to Memorise or internalize things
Things in which I'll get bad -
I want to see myself good in these
Confident comes from when you are good at something
More good/resourceful/effective/refined at that
This tech is perfectly quenching for my perfection
Jack of all trades
Are you good in it, and how/the-way you are good in it
Group them by >20, 20, 15, 10, 5, <5, 0
Don't fake the entries to get them to higher charts otherwise all will be in top in no time and there will always be no path to grow/improve
Write how how you are good in it, bcoz overall good in a thing is too vague, subjective and confusing
Achievements as their own doesn't matter, they should be in something and with respect to previous other achievements in that particular
With time, your achievements in a particular something can increased if focused on
This will show you your achievements in/regarding something
Achievements and achievements in them

But like a symphony, music notes, all connected into a beautiful song
All in all.. This list experiment is worth trying
Don't just write your achievements bcoz achievements within themselves doesn't matter. Write your achievements in a particular field
And these little little journeys will make your life interesting
Journey in drawing
Journey in swimming
Etc
With time, your achievements, for ex, in drawing field, will increase and whenever you look at that list, you will feel a sense of accomplishment, proud and meaning
This list will increase with time and will bind past present and future into a meaningful journey
Increase it as per your requirements
And a zeal to increase the list
This way, you want to cherish this kid
This kid of a chain you started
Your life will feel like a sweet set/bouquet of such meaningful little little journeys
That you want to cherish on and on
Which you rocked and rocking with your expanding list of things in which you are collecting achievements in each field
For ex, yoga
Yoga - I can do headstand now, I know about many pranayams and yogas now, I can do it for 30 min, i did it for 30 consecutive days..
Etc etc
You will feel meaningful
And future past present will not feel disconnected with each other
And that will make the future interesting , Past connected , And present energetic , Overall, a meaningful life
This list will be like a photo album, a legacy, a thing to be nostalgic upon , And a live manifesto
Let's create your list , Tell things in which you are good at , And then we can Compile the reasons you are good in them , What's your hobbies that you are good in
Also this good thingie is subjective.. Don't compare yourself with big writers
Your competition is with yourself
Competition with yourself. Standards of good wrt yourself. Ex, in drawing, standard of good is how you see it as good bcoz its subjective. Art is subjective. But sometimes it's competitive /objective too.. Like swimming
Achievements that feel and resonate to you
Something that look like achievement to you may not look like that to another, and achievement that look like achievement to someone else, may not look like achievement to you
That's why, i dont care when ronaldo ponaldo wins
Bcoz i'm not into football , N neither cricket , ??
This list will be like a personal resume
Resume meant for only yourself
So that you feel employed in the journey called as life
Employment for money is nothing in front of employment for meaning.. We all have jobs.. But not necessarily life
This will be a magic resume to keep us employed to the meaning, married to the magic
I'm doing this too
I'm using the list
I crave for meaning too
Infact everyone is craving
That's why, people are getting bored with fun
Meaning is necessary
Peace comes from meaning
It motivates for future
Things in which you were decent -
Things in which you were average -
Things in which you were bad -
Things in which you were too bad -
Things in which you were untolerable -
Move old n new me tech here
Things in which you are these these days -
Good -
Decent-
Average-
Excellent-
Amazing-
Meh-
Y, bcoz it groups and categorise rewards and results
You will quickly want to become good in amap things
Good in things but in those things which matter and are accomplishment in itself.. Like good in farting is not that cool goal whereas good in swimming is something. Unless you see good in farting as a cool goal too
Potential of improvement
Or you can say multiple sub-desires
A person is considered good in something when he can find more subdesires in that then others can in that
Bcoz you want to be more good in only those things in which you are already good
You want to do things for that which you like.. For ex, you like swimming, but not programming language. But if programming language becomes necessary, then start finding things in that in which you are already good bcoz then you will want to be more good in it. 
If you want to pursue anything, find how you are already good in it,
If you don't like a thing , make sure you like the sub in it
Divide into likes and not
In each category, also write the total amount of entries, and also give label to each category. Ex, 20 things I'm excellent in excellent category,  30 things I'm good in good category
Also divide into imp achievements, and other achievements
Divide them into..  I think i can get more achievements in these, i can't imagine/find more achievements that i can get in these
Only those things are motivating in which you are already enough good, so, yes, group them by 20, 15 etc bcoz you want to be good in those in which you already is good at some levels
now if you've start compiling the list, group them into.. Things in which you are really good, things in which you are good, things in which you are not that good, etc
Vertical instead of horizontal
Already and future, check boxes
An udit
You are married to yourself
Treat yourself
One can never get tired of treating someone he love
N if you treat you as yourself then it may get boring
So treat you as someone else

Motivation is fickle
Not when u feel like it but u may feel like doing it after doing it or starting it or doing it for five minutes
In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it. You get to feel good afterwards.
Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.
How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a positive feedback loop.
Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.
Motivation is not to be discarded but just not see as an entire solution. Treat it as side beneficiary of discipline system.
Motivation can never be enough and consistent and timed and continuous to tackle the resistances in doing this step/substep for this desire but a strategic n systematic approach to it which can be collectively denoted as discipline
Motivation] Future decisions/choices

Opportunity to start new with neighbours

How many days
Project
You are sad and you don't feel motivation for desires bcoz you don't see in how many days, you will get to them. You see them as indefinite.
When there is days guessed, you don't hurry and you know they are achievable
Even if you don't know how they will feel, you know that they have some good results for sure and worth trying out
It's not about time, it's about in how many days it will get done. It can't be done in few days even with too much you give continuous dedicated time to them bcoz they also need trial and error, thoughts etc
Deadlines.
You get demotivated when you trying to achieve a thing in one go.. With thinking of giving full time and efforts in one go and you couldn't bcoz its not possible.
You don't give a fuck about future
Car driving license - 6 months maybe,   car -  2 months maybe,  books scraping excel -  1 week maybe,  
Rome wasn't build in a day
Keto got successful bcoz you didn't expected it in one day
Failures don't demotivate you, expectations of quick results do
It's not that motivation motivates you.. It's demotivation that demotivates you

strong emphasis on getting your to-dos out of your head and into a system you can refer to. This clears your mind of any mental distractions that will keep you from working efficiently.
----------------
Mini habits

ABC your day
•Make a list of everything you have to do for the day
•Prioritize the items on your list Using A, B, C, D, E Rules
•Prioritize the letters with numbers. So if you have 5 'A's', number them from 1-5 in order of most(1) to least(5) important. 
•Do the list IN THAT ORDER. You may not move onto another task until the previous one is completed. So A1-A2-A3-A4-A5-B1-B2....ect.
ABC Rules
•A= Absolutey Must Do 
•B= It would be BEST if you could do it
•C= I don't Care if this doesn't get done today
•D= Delegate this task to someone else
•E= Eliminate from day-Cross it off the list
Other notable ideas:
•1 minute of planning saves you 10 minutes in the real world. 
•80:20 rule: 20% of the items on your list will account for 80% of the value
Also write y

No zero day
The Rules:
1. No More Zero Days
•Promise yourself that you will do one thing every day that takes you one step closer to your goal(s)
2. Be Grateful To The Three "You"s
•Past Self: Thank your past self for the favours they did for you
•Present Self: Do your future self a favour - they deserve it!
•Future Self: Your absolute best friend, and a great person.
3. Forgive Yourself
•It's okay to fuck up. Forgive your past self, and be a better friend for your future self.
4. Exercise and Books
•Get your heart rate up and try to read when you can. Also the easiest way to avoid a Zero Day!

Motivation is fleeting but discipline not,  also reasonable Motivation
You will never "feel like" doing something that you should do. You just have to do it.
just do it.
when you have something you need to do, there's a moment where you're like "man, I need to do that," but think: "I'll just do it later when I'm in the mood." So far as I know, that mood never comes. So the moment you think "man, I need to do that," is the moment you have to do it. It isn't easy, but it's the only way to get it done. Plus you'll feel good afterwards.
I'm talking about the things that you know you should do or maybe just really want to, but it's easier to do something else. That's the point I'm getting at here. Those are the things that you just need to forget about feelings, and just do them.
if you don't feel like doing something, do it for 5 minutes. You'll get sucked in, get the job done, and move on with your life. It works wonders with laundry!

Don't do it. Only initiation and the momentum will catch up.
Just do it
Persistence (even 15 min) daily is recommended than overwork/amount (2 hour marathon)
Can't I dedicated this this much time out of that much time
Whatever u do , do it as break from rest of the other things like u do meditation(sitting, watching breath) as break from rest of the other things.
Enjoy what u r doing
Be in present
Certaining a thing Acc to time makes it easy
While doing it , be happy that you are doing something which u wanted to do and decided and which is good for your that desire , which is making u feel.. And will make u feel..
Flexible approaches
Before starting that , properly end last thing so that it won't divert/disturb u there
Flexibility
Alternative ways
Present [daily results , efforts today 4 present and future , ]
When all results will happen together only..what before that?
-------------------- daily results
Imagine you getting results daily. Ex, in powers like health wealth etc, also in desires like girls, diecast cars etc. Usually when you imagine, you think of all results in future as if they all will happen together or in a batch or single day. Just like negative results daily can break you up and makes you demotivated and hopeless, this tech will work reversely.
Only Result don't matter, neither is journey to it, but a journey full of results
Don't only busy in planning, set/execute such that daily results
Log daily advancements /results
Imagine getting results daily in these
Daily
Monthly
..
See it as a reward 4 that effort you did
It's very very hard and almost impossible to motivate you for future and for efforts if you are not getting results daily, so, work up dt such that daily results n not in future only.
Things I got by efforts that I'm using daily -
Updated pc
Weight loss
Event ghost ecosystem
Tasker scripts
So many synchronicities
Good height shoes
Good dressing
Maybe divide by health, wealth etc
Also divide by high efforts, medium efforts, etc
..
-------------------- efforts today for present and future
Best way to motivate yourself is not to say about a good future but present
You would have enjoying those things by now if you have done those efforts..
For ex, you would be driving your dream car by now if you were more serious about it
You would be living in your dream house by now if you were more serious about it
You would have enjoying lucid dreams by now if you have given them a serious try
Etc etc
This trick quickly makes you motivated
Not future but present. - gratitude, I would have those things by now n enjoying by now,..
If you've done that.. You would be doing these or having these by now -
You would be feeling good about - 
You would be enjoying these wildly - sex with that girl, 
You would be scripting in python
You would be in your independent home
You would be living in good country
You would have taken revenge with jf
You would have solved this
You would have that version of it instead of that
You would have been enjoying it and similar unknown positive experiences of it
You would have factory/ies in delhi
You would have taken those risks
You would have learnt those things/skills
You would have finished those tasks
You would have managed that excel amazon doc
You would have finished read that book
You would have more ways to enjoy your introvertedness
You would be offline dating girls
You would be managed by now
You would have ended your fear of death
You would have finished that by now
You would be a popular tiktoker by now
You would have an active youtube channel by now
You would have learned all the ways to control your dad
You would be beleiving that by now
You already would have been enjoying exponential success
You would have friended..
You would have been done those tasks today
You would be using the current day productively
You would be that by now
Note - but count the blessings too. Things that you would be suffering from or that you wouldn't have if..
Divide the meta and non meta
Maybe this was the energy behind gambling tech
This tech will stop or not let you think and just make you act

[21/12, 3:38 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): *you think you've seen it all.. About the world.. You think you know what there is to this world.. But the more you grow.. The more hidden worlds you'll see within this world.. Just like few years ago, you didn't knew about law of attraction, just like few years ago, you didn't knew about lucid dreaming,.. Etc
[21/12, 3:40 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): It's easy to get a general idea about the world from a very early age from our family, schooling, media etc and we get certain after that, what what to expect from the world, that what what the world can give us, what what to desire
[21/12, 3:42 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): But when you grow, in desires and experiences, you'll find more intrinsic worlds that you'll be amazed to notice were hidden from your plain sight.. It's like getting a new sense and suddenly you can see Things where were already there in this same world but you were oblivious bcoz you just didn't have the required sense.
[21/12, 3:43 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Just like, how many animals don't have eyes n they can't see the beautiful colors we all humans can see in this beautiful coloured world
[21/12, 3:44 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): And similarly, how we humans can't listen to some spectrums of the sounds,
[21/12, 3:45 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Other worlds exist right in this world.. You just don't have the required senses to detect them.
[21/12, 3:45 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Upgrade yourself
[21/12, 3:46 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Psychedelic drugs temporarily unlocks few of those senses and they get to see beings from other worlds
[21/12, 3:47 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Imagination is a biggest sense that can transcends into all the worlds
[21/12, 3:47 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Since imagination itself created all these worlds
Mysteries in my life that can add mysterious elements to my life -
Occult, loa, synchronicities
Ld, dreams
Imagination

Future is awesome bcoz there will be interesting problems in future. And it's always fun to solve interesting problems. Life is problems and one can never get rid of problems, but wish, that atleast they be interesting.
Bcoz where there are interesting problems, there are interesting solutions
There will be interesting projects in future.
Visualise a future which is not letting you bored
Visualise a life/future so interesting it is not letting you think or worrying about meaning of life or tension of death. That it feels like.. Fuck future.. Let me enjoy the present.. Bcoz it's so beautiful
--------
Imagine a day where you've get multiple powers - ex - eventghost, social skills, ddy control, python, big dick n a girl n your ideas,
Or got to know how to use
Or things which you can use in multiple creative ways for fun n productivity n growth
Imagine you get (in just one day) 5 or more new toys to play
Lineup
That was Not about results but
Multiple solutions to try
Stack up the problems so that 95%, and than finish them to 100 in one day. You'll love that day.
Imagine 5 long time problems solved in one day
Imagine a life where these are working together -
Social skills
Gf
..
Multitask
We all have few areas in life, like health wealth relationships spirituality etc. Suppose you are not seeing great results in love department, than work on the health department, bcoz the results in health department will help in love department. All the results of each department helps each other.
If you are seeing good results in love department and not health department, work on love department bcoz soon the results will make you motivate you to work for health department too
Life is not linear
If you can't do thing A, and can do thing B, than do thing B. Bcoz soon otherwise you'll regret of not doing thing B too in the tension of thing A
Multitask. Switch to another task if one task stuck
And when the second task stuck, switch to first
And you'll never get free.. You'll always have interesting things where you are switching the moment one thing stuck
Life is not linear
Don't see Netflix as something external. It is a task too. It comes in rest department. See it as a chore too.
And now you'll feel productive bcoz you are not seeing Netflix as something guilty
But just another task which it is
I always find it difficult to do an isolated task. I do them in flow. And not a single one at a time. I do them in flow and in multitasking way. I divided all my tasks into three categories. Outside tasks, house tasks, and pc tasks. I do one session of outside tasks a week (like going to markets for buying things etc), two sessions of pc a day, 3 sessions of house tasks a day.
When you see Netflix, you already doing a chore. You are in flow of doing chores.
Same with meditations
And when I'm doing one session, I don't mix tasks from another session. Now i can easily get in the zone. And can fulfill multiple tasks
I did the same with exercises. I divided all the exercises into positions. Like sitting exercises, standing exercises, laying exercises. This way I don't have to change my body setting all time
Instead of batch results, set batch solutions.. Deliberately delay solving things so that all in batch.. Fulfill all at 95%..kinda diffusive thinking..
Nothing should be given the only attention. Multitask. Diffusive thinking. Batch results. Enjoying progresses switchingly.
Visualise it increasing your hunger rather than quenching it
Just be happy in knowing that there are many great ideas written in dt which you can't remember now. Like in seduction doc. Imagine cashing/using them.
Life is chasing things? Like girls?
Set a day in week for batch results
Multiple progresses and results simultaneously. Batch winnings. Multiple projects giving results simultaneously in switching way . And checking all progresses/developments switchingly is super fun.
Visualise a future which is not letting you feel bored. Goal is to increase the quality of ..
Visualise yourself getting big opportunities
Visualise yourself finding new ways to enjoy it while you enjoying it
95%
Cashed out days..
A day where I cashed out 95% done to full
Ex, a day where I cashed out results of girls.. Like enjoying girls for which I have halted all progress to 95%
It's easy to spend the day
Don't worry.. You'll never get bored in a day.. You will always have something to enjoy.. There are so many desires n activities
Imagine you multi tasking interesting projects
Workaholic
Diffusive thinking
Imagine yourself balancing in thousands of interesting things
--------
Things that don't happen now which you hated -
Ashoki singing
R tai face
..
Even if the day didn't feel like moving or productive enough, be happy that atleast it is not one of these days -
One where you sleep most of the day, like upto 5 pm
Or no work on pc, just outside time waste
Or no work in home, just lazying out
Or a day of full day quarrel
Or a day of ranting/blaming/complaining
Or a day of Repairing only one task
Or a day of recheckings
Or a day of sleepiness or foggy mind
Procrastinating
A day of recovering from fapping
A day of joint family quarrel
A day of fever
A day of bad weather
A day of urgent time limited unavoidable tasks
Maybe - A day of regretting
A day of having to hang up with someone you don't like
A day without hunger
A day without worrying about where to sleep or of worrying about theft
A day without worrying about kids and their future
A day where I'm hypnotized by some chut religion
A day where I had to work with that stupid old unupdated pc
A day..
A day worrying about ashoki bhajan etc
A day stuck with one task
A day worrying about bindu
A day worrying about your obesity
A day managing shame of your fat
A day seeing faces of people you hate
Meta - A day of some serious issue or problem
Meta - A day worrying about that problem
Meta - A day where you would be feeling that feeling
Note - Add those things which you get in 2019 etc - like ac, updated pc, sector house, etc..
*be happy that it is not one of those days.*
You may hate the current day bcoz it is not productive or not that productive
But be happy bcoz it is atleast not one of those days
It could be one of these days but it isn't -
- A day where you only rant, blame and complain
- A day where you sleep most of the day
- A day where you'll be roaming outside doing nothing
- A day where you'll be inside home doing nothing
- A day of quarrel
- A day where you had to repair something and couldn't do any other thing bcoz of it
- A day with foggy, groggy or cloudy or sleepy mind
- A day of procrastination
- A day with pain from some health issue
Etc
Today could be easily be one of the above days, but if it isn't, feel grateful even if it is not that productive
More such days -
- A day of breakup
- A day of finding your SO cheating
- A day of public shaming
- A day of bullying
Etc
Be happy that today is not any of these days
And that's why I'm grateful
A day doesn't need to be + in order for it to be great, if it is not in -, it is good
More such days -
- A day where you lose your mobile, pc or whatsapp data
- A day where burglary happen
- A day where something bad happen to someone close to you
- A day where you are about to get evicted from house bcoz of due rents
Etc
Today is not any of such day
Isn't it wonderful
You survived through all or some of the above in your lifetime, so, you know the value of how good it feels to not have to face anything like that
And yes it is not one of a day you hate
Something to be grateful for In a reverse psychology way
the best feeling is in the night of the knowing that you have efforted enough in day for a better future and you did those efforts in a fun way
Exponential success
effort for a future where you become someone who can take better care of the child/dreamer in you
I would be doing that pc by now instead of this
Confidence.. It is addictive.. You want to feel confident.. More confidence more better. Usually, we are surrounded by doubts. Things of which we can confident about makes us slowly slowly close to the big n big truth
Synchronicities is the biggest one. Lost 30 kg in health area, pharmacy in wealth area, lots of online and offline friends in social area, automated many projects in pc in digital area, peace and understanding in many things in spiritual area, etc
Imagine you as highly disciplined
I could have these enjoying by now
Instead of that day, that day
Alone n lonely n horny, with gf n sex n love
Family quarrel, fun with family n bonding
Feeling choiceless, shopping etc
Overwhelmed n frustrated with dt, feeling managed with dt
Feeling unhealthy, feeling healthy
Feeling poor, feeling rich
Feeling bullied, feeling in charge
Feeling tied to rohtak, travelling
Harassment by jf, revenge
If you have efforted, you probably would have these by now -
Have dated Shubhangi - and from that -
Multiple Gfs and daily frequent sex - and from that -
Some good job in foreign - and from that -
Height - and from that -
Meds shop - and from that -
I would have managed and using these docs by now - ddy, gf, rechecking,..
I would have these records by now - nofap 90 days,
I would have done these tasks by now -
I would start /stop be beleiving these
I would start/stop these habits
I would have tried/tasted these
I would have taken/tried these risks
Notes - 
Types of efforts - serious, a little bit extra (from 99%), consistent,
By at time.. (2 years ago, in past, finished, by now etc)
Is this neville live in end tech?
Create excel columns - from that, type of effort, by time.., by balancing, by adjusting,
Bcoz things only look fun and desirable when in present and near
This also makes it believable
If you have efforted, your life would be moving by now
This is also meaning of life
Since morning, I would have done these.. Many tasks
I would have cashing that by now
Y this tech is not viable - bcoz i was busy, bcoz i need rest, bcoz opposings, bcoz No ideas, bcoz..
If.. That would be a living normal reality now
Merge those points to this tech
Maybe write dt in this tech way
Sexual -
By now -
Multiple gfs with which daily sex
Fully sexed up
Today -
Street house date
Shagging her hard for 2-3 hrs
Right now -
Receiving nudes on mobile
Laying with her in arms or getting a bj
Social -
Money -
Health -
Digital -
Loa -
..
Volatility/liability
9-Jan-18
9:11
Ddy
Particular desires
Experiment with micro-dosing (absorb the properties of a thing)
Smells - ponds powder , soaps , deos , aggarbatti etc , spray, perfumes
Orgasmic feelings -  khuja,  maalish,..  Kaan me khuja
Books and magazines subscribe like osho, indiatoday, comics etc
Arts - drawing , woodworking, potting , clay ,
Singing - what is love ,
Songs I like-  what is love, ..
Dance - work on each body part to make it flexible and run by your emotions and feelings
Project pug - 
Shops, price - 12k, care - food, med
Cinemagraphs art
Girl's with plaid shirt
A future where you can beleive those things easily
I remember I used to notice smells in childhood , my nose sense was good
Imagine yourself solving or getting to solve your problems quickly, of all types and difficulties
I would be bathing like that instead of this
I would be doing that instead of that
Imagine things happening as intended
You might want to see your potential.. Of what you can become
Maybe goal is to become more choiceful
Imagine you not have to do this
Imagine a life with all ideas from dt fully automated
finding hidden results from your previous efforts
Imagine a future in which your present day and next 10 days will gonna be awesome
I would have started that by now
Imagine whatever you work for, you get helped by luck n loa
Visualise a future where you are instantly/easily getting motivated
Visualise a future in which you are feeling fresh and full of opportunities
Do you want to sleep peacefully at night?
Just do two things before sleeping..
Try to remember things you did for the present happiness
like eating something tasty, or watching a movie etc
And
Try to think of things you did for the future happiness like exercise, investment, bought something that will be useful for an year like protein bucket
You'll sleep really peacefully when you know you took care (atleast for the quota of today) for both future and present happiness. Ignoring anyone is what creates problems in life.
People often ignore their present happiness bcoz of only caring for future happinesses or either, they ignore their future happinesses by only enjoying in present. This fook up their overall sense of wellbeing bcoz wellbeing includes well being of both, present and future
Tensioning or thinking about future happinesses is also efforts
While doing something for present happiness, know that you did things for future happiness too today, and when.. , this will make you content and tension free
How you are caring for happinesses of both
This is kinda loa tech too
--------------------
live by 2 ways daily. do things for present and do things for future.
when u ignore future for present , u will get sad inside that u r doing only instant gratification n not doing anything for future happiness
when u only do things for future happiness n not for present , u will get sad that u r not living in present and otliving life n not enjoying what u have
not-living*
so , best is to take care of both happinesses daily
happiness of present and happiness for future
bcoz imbalance in this is the reason of your sadness
Percentage in mix
Balancing both will make you happy in present and later in future too as bonus. This tech mainly helps for present and present happiness is the target which this helps achieve fully and later help in future happiness is aided bonus
----
How I'll be when I'm highly motivated , and for future - 
I would wake up early daily
I will not waste my time
Always excited
Dreamy eyes
Happy
..

[Method] I summarized all the top posts of the top self-help subreddits of all time into a cheatsheet.
# THEORY:
(Long time lurker, but this sub is pretty positive so I feel like I can share)
I had a theory.
The theory was that we are surrounded by information. In the sea of information, if we could sort all the most useful information into one book, we could provide a manual of life changing advice & help into one brief guide.
But how do we organize what is most important?
What better way to advocate for something being useful than an upvote right?
So I decided to find all the top self-help reddit threads of all time and read through all the top posts of this year. Then, I combined all the most common advice into a cheat sheet, with the most common advice prioritized at the top.
My end goal is to one day provide a "Basic Human Needs" course, where I could hopefully pass along all the useful advice I've collected from the over 300+ self-help books I've read and (literally) thousands of articles & posts I've combed through over time and form a virtual big brother / virtual mentor created from the internet.
(I never had a father to teach me stuff. Thanks to you all, I actually feel prepared for life.)
\-
# METHOD:
I first went to [http://redditmetrics.com/top](http://redditmetrics.com/top) and combed through the top 800 subreddits that had anything to do with self-help. These include getdisciplined, lifehacks, personalfinance, startup, and lots more.
I then opened up each subreddit, where I sorted by the top posts over the past year, and began to comb through each subreddit for common themes. Initial phases were rather difficult, because I had to type up anything that sounded like it would come up again.
After documenting all the themes, I then grabbed a new document and put together a clean list of all the things that began to repeat.
Anywhere that you see a x2, x3, etc. That is the number of times a concept is repeated almost verbatim in a post. Otherwise, it is ranked by how often the concept was loosely repeated.
I am fully aware that this isn't as scientific as I'd like this to be. I plan to do this again for All-Time, attach the spreadsheet of the data analysis, a list of subreddits analyzed and the posts within. I did not have enough time to do this over the weekend I could dedicate to this project.
**WARNING:** This is a prototype and it's ugly. Also, none of this is my opinion - just others.
\-
# RESULTS:
## Success:
1. Optimism makes people perform better. Most importantly, the optimism that literally anything can be defeated with enough effort. Every obstacle is *merely* a challenge, not a threat. x 8
2. Habits are what form and deform your life. Humans are short-sighted. Build a ritual that will, much like compound interest, build an amazing life. x6  
Working out twice a day for a week won’t do much. But a year could make for a transformation. Failure is not one dramatic fall, but a series of small failures, compounded over a longer period. X 5
3. Scale slowly. An overnight success still had 1 step up goals every hour. A billion dollar company once only had a goal of a million dollars. Set numerous small, achievable, bite sized goals - as opposed to a few, huge chunky goals. X 4
4. Authenticity is king. People enjoy authentic people, respect authentic people and welcome authentic people. x 4
5. Common sense beats all rules, stipulations and otherwise. You likely know most of what you learn, it’s simply being reorganized to fit your mind better. When it’s time to take action, trust that you know what you’re doing and focus solely on moving. x 3
6. Success comes from trying something, failing and modifying the action - Thousands of times. No amount of preparation (beyond the basic) can prepare you for the first day with sharks. ACTION + MODIFICATION = RESULTS x 3
7. Show small amounts of gratitude every day. Make it apart of your ritual. The gratitude forces you to focus on the things you are happy about. Small gratitude is low commitment and high reward. X 2
8. Establish 3 to 20 second barriers between bad habits. Take batteries out the remote. Put junk food in trunk of car. It won’t stop you completely. But it will decrease significantly. Make positive habits easier. Pack a healthy lunch. X 2
9. A huge part of succeeding at something is simply showing up. Even if that means you just walked in the door and back out. If you show up, the math says you’ll succeed, eventually. X 3
10. Go 150% + beyond what you are expected to do. This is a 100% way to gain immediate traction. Applied with consistency can skyrocket results. x 2
11. Practice task isolation. The only thing that matters in that moment is the task at hand. Work on that task only until you are ready to stop. Nothing else matters until. X 2
12. Constantly be evaluating yourself. Every year, every month, week, day, hour. - Do this 100% objectively and healthily. The more you look at yourself objectively and decide what you’re doing right and wrong, the better feedback you can use to improve. X 2
13. If you are always the smartest person in the room, you’re probably in a room full of idiots or you’re lying to yourself.
14. Double down on your strengths. Neutralize your weaknesses. Make them just capable enough to swim still water.
15. Adaptation is the key to survival. You cannot run over a jungle, but with the right small, frequent adjustments, you can run through a jungle.
16. Discipline is not just following a plan when you need a plan, but following the plan when you’ve succeeded. Make a plan and follow it, regardless of your emotions.
17. When you first wake up, try breathing faster and faster until hyperventilation. It makes your body kick into awake mode quickly.
18. Try fasting from a bad habit completely. Replace it with something less bad. Over time, you can replace a lot of small bad habits with less bad habits and get big change.
19. Organization, habits and the process of planning is actually all simply tools to clear space in your brain. You cannot use a car efficiently if it is jammed to the ceiling with clothes and furniture that belong in your house. And the furniture and clothes can’t be used correctly either.
20. Take stock in the understanding that 90% of successful people are doing a lot of hustle underneath the glam and money. They wake up early, they skip parties and they work - A LOT.
21. Automate literally every task you do not enjoy. It will make your life focus on the things you do enjoy.
22. Most habits can be changed by finding the belief rooted to it and finding all the evidence you can to break it. - “The gym is a chore.” \*Watch documentaries about people who love the gym\* "I love sugary foods" \*Watch documentaries about sugar causing disease\* - You are what you subscribe to.
23. Tell no one your goals. Talking gives you a rush of endorphins and dopamine. You “dope yourself out” on talking and never get anywhere.
24. No amount of regret can bring back the dead. Love immensely and give your friends and family what they deserve as soon as possible and as often as possible.
25. Chain together successful tasks and create the illustration of commitment, thus reducing your likelihood to miss out. - Crossing off days on a calendar chains a habit and thus reduces the chance to break it.
26. Stage every commitment so you only give what you get back, and scale it slowly. Put in 1 cent, if it gives back 1 cent, then put in 5 cents. If it gives back 5 cents, continue. Never Give 100% to an idea you haven’t tested at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% etc.
27. Never show your cards first in a negotiation. The offer they have in mind may be much higher than you’re thinking.
28. In a dispute, ask for proof of everything. Make the process draining for the other party if you’re in the right and they are forcing you to wade through mud.
## Finance:
1. Every successful person saves money. EVERY. SUCCESSFUL. PERSON. SAVES. MONEY. Save, at the very least, 10%
2. Every successful person invests. Invest in a bank, invest in real estate, invest in yourself. No matter how you invest, it’s the only way to grow. Spend your money on things that grow. - This includes your health.
3. Do not skip on insurance. The peace of mind that disaster will not ruin you is worth the duty paid.
4. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
## Social:
1. Listen to people. Ask open-ended questions to get someone to talk. Why, what and how questions. To enhance listening, look for a one sentence life lesson to take from every story / interaction. x 4
2. You are upset because no one calls you to do things. So is the person who didn’t call you. Initiate activity. This is a solid way to be invited to more things, meet new people and have fun. X 2  
   1. Group activities are always more comfortable.
   2. Have a specific plan in place of who, what, when, where & why.
   3. Sometimes the event will fall apart. This is common. Do it anyways. It’s worth it.
   4. Social people invite others out when they feel lonely. Antisocial people wait for a phone call. Antisocial people have a higher probability of being lonely.
3. Traveling & expanding your social circle makes you more confident in who you are.
4. Be 10% more excited than the person you are talking to in positive conversations.
5. You have value to add to every interaction. Whether it’s with a CEO or a janitor. No matter your past - If you’ve burned many bridges, at least you had bridges to burn.
6. If 10 people in a row reject you as a friend, that’s only .000000015 percent of the world’s population. You’ve got a whole lot more to choose from.
7. Small talk is the door to deep friendship. You must make small talk first. You first said “Hi” to your significant other, you first had an interview at a company. People need to know you won’t stab them before they want to hang out.
8. Letting go of the thought that people have to like you is the best decision you will ever make. People would have liked or disliked you regardless of how lightly you tread.
9. Talk to people’s emotions. A metalhead and a classical music lover can connect on how emotional they get during a raw, deep piece.
## Health:
1. Get 6-8 hours of sleep. It can cause huge detriments to your wellbeing to get less. X 3
2. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. X 2
3. Sleep is one of the more important aspects of health, right beside nutrition and exercise. Master these three and you are doing well.
4. Optimum sleep temperature is 61-64 degrees F. Optimal sleep warm up is 1 hour before bed to begin process attempting sleep. - No screens, no exercise, no stress.
5. Meditation provides a range of health benefits.
6. Exposure to nature prevented hay fever and other illnesses in cavemen.
7. Stem cells regrow the body.
8. Alcohol consumption linked to many diseases we didn’t think - such as Alzheimer's, Dementia, Cancer, etc. Alcohol companies are funding research to make alcohol okay or “healthy”. X 2
9. Not exercising is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease.
10. Tobacco use linked to a quarter of a billion life-years lost vs. illegal drugs accounting for only tens of millions.
11. Education linked to better health than income. Intelligent people make smarter health decisions that prevent the need for reactive, potentially too-late healthcare.
12. Dropping smartphones from evening activity led to 93.6% of participants opting to keep their phones off at night. - Increased happiness, focus & wellbeing.
13. Dark chocolate is a superfood. Good for health and mind.
## Business:
1. WHO matters most, then WHY, then HOW, then WHAT, then WHEN. Hire the right people with the right motives who follow a great plan and what you do and when you do it should work out on it’s own. x 2
2. Facebook, Uber, AirBnb, eBay - All got their start connecting two people together who could help each other. None have inventory, shipping centers, etc.
3. Buy low, sell high. Every business is in the business of buying something cheaper than they sell it. Simplify your business by asking what you’re buying for cheap, and selling for more.
4. Personal letters are the only way to get through a noisy world today. Find a way to personalize every communication you send.
5. The product will sell itself. Build a product that people will talk about.
6. Test EVERYTHING. We live in a hyper-feedback world. Run test after test and build on what works. Methodically test every single aspect of your business.
7. “Big Picture” thinkers don’t work well in a startup. You need detail oriented thinkers to calculate every move and thought.
8. Ideas are like treadmills. It can be a catalyst to something great, but will require you to execute methodically and frequently. A treadmill without work is worthless.
9. One of the most common failures in business & personal is the mismanagement of funds. Be very meticulous with how you spend your money.
10. The best marketing is word of mouth. Talk to the loudest birds and get noticed effortlessly.
11. Know your worth. Ask for that raise. It costs money to replace an employee, and it could be a significant amount.

Im not sure if I can post links here, but if someone wants it, I have a printable Google Doc of the cheat sheet. I read it once a week or so.
I also did this with most sold self-help books of all-time if anyone is interested.
Evolving dreams
New desires everyday
Getting
Getting 10 new desires everyday
Imagine such days/life where you spend your day such that you get new desires (10 for example) for tomorrow/s
Desires or cool projects or ideas to try/execute
Everyday I'm getting new -
cool Pc projects,
awesome books to read,
interesting girls that I can get numbers if I try,
cool youtube videos,
cool Spotify recommendations,
new ideas for your powers (health, wealth etc),
Not just new but that which you can cash /try /execute/start working on etc tomorrow
That i can cash/try/.. Tomorrow
See that list
You are thinking about the meaning of life now, you'll be thinking about meaning of life in future and old age, difference is, do you want to think about the meaning of life and other mysteries of life, comfortably or uncomfortably.
Imagine how good it would be to think on it, with a good high end pc setup
With a girl who discuss that with you, while you making love to her
In a safe and cozy house
.. Etc
This technique doesn't tell you the meaning of life, but it knows for sure that you'll be finding that in your future and old age too.
Can you think about life being under tensions of family etc?
Can you think about life on mountains with the worldly desires?
..
Can you think about it with tension of money
Can you think about it with a tired body and mind (bcoz of nofap etc)
Can you think about it with daily family quarrels
Imagine thinking, the speed of thinking etc on meaning of life, with..
Maybe this is the second biggest meaning of life.. The second biggest meaning of life is to find the first main meaning of life
Think /wonder/curious about the world /meaning
[22/12, 1:49 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Imagine there is 2 versions of you standing 10 feet apart in future. One, who was lazy but created smart ways and worked on them and who became the ideal version, second, who was lazy and created smart ways but never worked on them, and is poor and overall loser.
First is looking at second with empathy, and mercy
Second is looking at first with jealousy
Which side so you want to be?
[22/12, 1:53 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): First is full of choices
Second is choiceless
[22/12, 1:55 PM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): We are rich by how many choices we have. A rich is riding a cycle, a poor is riding a cycle. But the first one is happy and the second one is full of complexes of riding a cycle, bcoz the first one knows that he have choice to drive a car, or a motorbike, or taking an Uber anytime. No such thing with the one who have only cycle
? Life is new ahead
ThIngs i liked which i most probably will see in future too
Will see or managed to see
Time available for it
Which i can cash/enjoy in future too
Do things which you will like and will see/enjoy in future too
Future is good bcoz these things which i liked in past is highly possible and probable to repeat/happen-again in future
gratitude is not being happy about good things in past , but being happy about those good thIngs in past which are going to happen again
what fun are those memories of things and not but tease which isn't going to happen again.
which are easily n spontaneously going to happen , not by effort etc
this is what gratitude is all about
this is counting blessings of future
near future maybe
This is pretty laidback tech
what's the difference between this tech and that memories monthly.. tech (with easy entries)
Easiness
This tech sees happiness in future acc to good past statistics , that tech is just about enjoying good past statistics
see that monthly desires list
the thing is to be happy that those good things of past aren't just limited to past.
I start and increase hating life when i think or feel that a good thIng is not going to happen again ,or 
What about new desires , first time , which didn't happen before
___________________
list of good thIngs that will happen ,or most probably happen , upcoming
also create a list of single events that are upcoming which might be good ,ex , vaishno devi trip.  First time.
why? Bcoz acceleration of past , bcoz did happened in past , bcoz chances , bcoz intuitions , bcoz flow ,..
its not about past
Should i also write list of bad things
list of good/bad things that regularly happen
List of good thIngs which i might get to enjoy first time ,numerous times
Easily , not difficultily , or not that Much difficultily
Which are kinda free
Which kInda happen by itself
_________________________
List of good things which are certain In this month or in this year or today or tomorrow
If you have good discipline , then that helps too. But this tech itself will motivate you to do this
write in this list only those things which you've made certain , not that which you are going to make certain
Trying to make a thing certain bcoz you have added it in this list will put pressure.so, add only those things whIch you've made certain.
not fake promises but real deal
Certain , not unsure. Not decisive , not deliberate.
pre celebrate them
To make yourself beleive in the certainty criteria , check after that time pass. And improve your certainty criteria accordingly.
Strikethrough them which is in list but isn't certain in this month but was previous month , instead of removing them
There is no such thIng as high fun or low fun , anything which you've done in desired way is high fun
Things jinme meri marji chalegi
find things which are once enabled/achieved are easy to do in desired way
Find things which give me number of things to do in desired way ,ex , video gaming - jumping , shooting ,..
There is no desired ways but desired way , there is no highly desired way no lower. Only desired way.
Gratitude is not about beautiful past but beautiful future
this gives you confidence , excitement
this is loa
You are always motivated for things you can do in desired way
things which could happen , potential
Things which kinda scheduled by themselves
List of things which i knowingly did in desired way there in vaishno devi

Certain things
good thIngs which i.can do numerous times in this month , year , near coming time
New things , New ways , old which will doesn't feel like old but new , new or first time in this month ,..
maybe group by amount of newness
Newness gives curiosity, life , interest , excited ,..
Life is new ahead , not old. And new in positive way. This helps in Loa
Newness here and there in life
Things which will certainly improved in this month ,..
Things which get improved/downgrade this month
Improved in case of fun factor
Enjoy already improvement of things ,ex ,of porn
Maybe group dt by things which can be improved , easily and quickly
But what about new , distraction , numerous times ,..
improvement show that life is maturing and have sense and meaning
Journey is fun
Downgrades that will come - fap , eyes ,..
Downgrades that could come - extreme poverty , jf ,
Things which i can improve easily , with not much effort -
Improvements which stayed for long -
Improvements which will stay for some time -
bcoz you have these highly distracting (from problems and tensions) things ahead
why this thinking - problems and tensions are constant and remain always, so , find those things which make you distracted from them.
But what about facing them - face them in their time , not all time. Face them using desired ways (that doc) , face one at a time.
Distraction is required for concentration. Like destruction is required for construction
escapism
Immersive
this is using bad in good way , using bad for good. Yinyang , good in bad , thinking differently.
this will make you tensions free
this is using death and suicide.bcoz this tech uses escapism but in desired and good way.
This is great tech , bcoz you actually have been using dt to escape ever since
This is deep insight and big big tech
mind distracted , not else
Highly distracted from all of life bad things , which will give me false hope or illusions maybe too
Not only tensions etc but other things or desires etc too
Distraction from Suicidal thoughts , depression , tensions , problems ,
It helps in Loa bcoz letting go by distraction
From finding meaning of life , happiness searching etc
Those desired ways techs is also ways to distract yourself ways
Car , girl ,tv , miracles , religion , loa,..
I have been using bad things unconsciously for distractions , like revenges , quarrels etc
That's why so many techs , epiphanies etc
Sleep (insomnia) , meditation , memories ,..
good thIngs which certainly will not clash/interfere with other programs/tasks etc

Things which i will certainly be doing differently -
More big the list , more you will be arranging to increase the list. There will always be that one thing which you certainly will be going to do differently.
differently for considerable amount of time
group by compared to past or present
differently doesnt mean that badly or old ways bcoz.. Time always improves things and gives new improved ways
It is good tech bcoz it is a promise of changing your current monotonous life
I m nothing but bored with current life
It is relevant to my current actual day to day life , not about sth in future
Imagine the extreme to motivate yourself. Ex , living with very weak knees for unknown amount of time
Imagine same long amounts of time
Imagine it same with rest different
Could you have imagined that that time , that it will be this different
Big picture
If you have old junky activa , imagine not bullet but 10,000 cc bike. Imagine not just one but multiple ways of doing it differently
tie it with .. Things you desperately want to do differently, with which you are desperately bored
Things you cannot do differently.
new things that certainly will happen that will add laziness..
Check sections of dt
I want the laziness that comes with/after it , not this laziness
I want the laziness with/in that contrast. Ex , ship cabin amidst roaring sea
Laziness , feeling cozy and secure and comfort zone and protected
This tech is finding cool new comfort zones (w.r.t contrast of risks)
Life feels good amidst death
See it in this laziness , also step
This tech as it is in start , just laziness
Mental laziness , is this laziness more immersive or the car would be
Things that have enhanced my laziness - toilet , mobile , rooms ,pc , furniture , foods , clothes etc ,
Knees - i want to be lazy while standing , not tensed
Jaal - i want to be lazy while sitting on terrace , not tensed
Bike - i want to be lazy while driving , not tensed
The high quality luxurious laziness
Different ways to be lazy , different ways to enjoy your laziness
The unique way it will help me breathe
This is using laziness , laziness tech
This is highly relevant tech which uses the most distracting n demotivational thing
Do things to maintain this luxury of laziness which is not letting me do it in first place. Find this point.
Big[ Be as if you r finding or discovering the benefits, etc n didn't knew before.
Something about which youve already knew before all about is not exciting .
That it can do it too? Etc
Surprises it will/can give
[30/08, 2:25 AM] Aditya Udit KGA: I found a way to be passionate...  Generally you visualise that Lamborghini will give you this and that pleasure / feature / facility etc. You now don't see the features or facilities etc as preknown but like realizing like on the spot, like oh i didn't knew Lamborghini can do this or i could use Lamborghini for that. Etc. Hope you get the gist. *bcoz this technique is making me crazy and passionate for my desires.*. Try to read this technique again and again and don't dilute or neutralize with prebiases. It really is a powerful one.
[30/08, 2:32 AM] Aditya Udit KGA: You want to be more passionate about it
[30/08, 2:33 AM] Aditya Udit KGA: Bcoz passion attracts things
[30/08, 2:35 AM] Aditya Udit KGA: So, about that dream job in your favorite city... You have guessed that it will offer you this and that.. Right.. But like always, you don't know some cool things which it could also offer you. Like for example, you could meet some celebrity who is related to that job in that city. You don't know this right but you will when you have the job
 N you will be like whoa i didn't knew this job can or will give me this too
[30/08, 2:36 AM] Aditya Udit KGA: So, imagine different scenarios n feel surprised that woah i didn't knew this can give me this too
I didn't knew this could be possible in this

Maybe this technique is working especially with nofap or bcoz of zeal from nofap
Like you were pretty ignorant about it, that it can do it
Undeclared benefits
Whoa, i didn't knew this before that it can do/give this too
I didn't knew I can use it like this too
I thought it would be boring
I didn't knew I can do these two together or simultaneously
I didn't knew that I can use it in it n like this
Be as if you didn't knew you can enjoy it like this too
I didn't knew it can offer something entirely new or there could be something entirely new in this or via or bcoz of this or after or before or while this
I couldn't have imagined it
Be as if you are discovering a known thing
Be as if you are getting interested in it as if you r discovering something cool about it
Be as if you are suddenly finding that it can also solve it or help solve it n in cool way or awesomely. Ex, car to solve fat problem by making it fun to go to park or swim
I'm learning so much in this.. Ex car
I didn’t knew that I could like it n so much
be as if you are learning things from it, to make yourself interested in it
Things jinke baare me lagta hai ki pehle kyu nahi mili/ya-pata-chala - ssd ,..     That I should have done or get it earlier  , where was it , regret of that , so awesome , ki ab tak toh next level hota

This is so so good ... I had never known these  profound distinctions between Intelligence and Wisdom BBC
Worth reading on ...
1. Intelligence leads to arguments.
Wisdom leads to settlements.
2. Intelligence is power of will.
Wisdom is power OVER  will.
3. Intelligence is heat, it burns.
Wisdom is warmth, it comforts.
4. Intelligence is pursuit of knowledge, it tires the seeker.
Wisdom is pursuit of truth, it inspires the seeker.
5. Intelligence is holding on.
Wisdom is letting go.
6. Intelligence leads you.
Wisdom guides you.
7. An intelligent man thinks he knows everything.
A wise man knows that there is still something to learn.
8. An intelligent man always tries to prove his point.
A wise man knows there really is no point.
9. An intelligent man freely gives unsolicited advice.
A wise man keeps his counsel until all options are considered.
10. An intelligent man understands what is being said.
A wise man understands what is left unsaid.
11. An intelligent man speaks when he has to say something.
A wise man speaks when he has something to say.
12. An intelligent man sees  everything as relative.
A wise man sees everything as related.
13. An intelligent man tries to control the mass flow.
A wise man navigates the mass flow.
14. An intelligent man preaches.
A wise man reaches.
Intelligence is good
but wisdom achieves better results.

A future where you can quickly enjoy your big Desires.. Like when you get bored , you call one of your gfs for Sex , or go to expensive massage ,or book a travel trip , or ..
Configurability is the fun and meaning of life
Life is revelatory
Imagine a future where you are content in fulfilling desires in imagination only
Imagine a future where you are not getting bored of anything , no matter how much you use it 
Imagine a mentally stimulating future. Challenging future.
Imagine being untethered like that in that or during that or there..
Zorba [can excelise these] -
Things i couldn't have done w/o dt or well or that well -
Keto
..
I could have done without dt but not that efficiently
Famous suicides

zorba new points [paste points above this line]======================================
spiritual
Visualise yourself happy in your house, this current house, in each room
Visualise yourself living multiple days in one
Be as if no one is thinking, no thought anywhere
Either full fun life or no fun at all.. No intermediate 
Make one day gold
Visualise a laugh filled life
Meanwhile..
Compound effect
I'm responsible. Its the best motivator. 
The time a person learned how to live, life ends
Create a list of lists i should have
Maybe divide Zorba doc into present and future
Be happy ki saare kaam bann rahe hai
Maybe use games to hook you to desktop, n once you sit on desktop, be productive, like onenote etc. similarly use girls and park etc to hook you to outside and once..
I think only powers will create desires
Give 1000 tries to everything.. Create excel
When you get helping ideas in open project
This batch of humans
*the time we get to know how to live life, it's too late*
You don't know how it will feel.. It is kind of gamble. Doc -gambles , later check that was it worth the effort or not.
What if you get new awesome tech in future
I can easily spend time.. Y worry.. All those years..
“Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities” -Tyrion Lannister
Visualise background dancers dancing for your life story all time like background music
You haven't existed before this life.. You are new
6-7 oct 19 - used full day [no late sleep etc] [productive]
When do you presume you'll do it and do you think you'll actually do it at that time? 
Imagine scary situations and you cozying nearly
Spend on hobbies
That point.. Even if you have tech/motivation or don't , you'll have the same time for things. So, y not do things with or without motivation
Even if you get motivation or don't, you'll have the same amount of time to do things. So, why not do things without motivation
What if I learned to manage my efforts and motivation
Imagine you feeling grateful for your life, a future where you are feeling grateful, good, awesome, blessed, lucky about your life, past and present. Keep efforting until..
Be happy that you are sad bcoz happiness don't teach anything and it can't help you grow
All techs in zorba want you to work n effort for a good future.. And give chance to future.. So, just do it.. Discipline.. And you can later match the techs in future.. Iykwim
I don't want to experience it.. I just want to feel the fact that I have experienced it, even if once, in past. Bcoz this will make me feel good about life n will make it see life as fulfilling n accomplished. N i want to feel this fact about many things
Efforts.. When you beleive that your efforts will actually make you forget bad memories of past and will actually work for a good future
Laziness is nothing but waiting for better ideas before working or efforting, and productive means to just start work with whatever ideas you have.. You need a balance between both.. You either just can't do efforts without proper thinking n you just can't always wait for better ideas.. 
Get insulted. It's a way to success. Log of getting insulted daily 
Get insulted daily
See how many things/experiences you get today n how many of them are..
Be happy that you are doing it your way , your desired way
Life is for fun
Work for it or maintain it bcoz if you will still don't have those things, you would have it atleast. Ex , work for fortuner car bcoz if you still won't have a bunglow in gurgaon , you atleast would have fortuner car
If you effort, you can get the results in one week which you will get in whole year otherwise
Imagine winning in your efforts again and again, and easily 
Imagine a future where you are getting new desires daily and you be able to fulfill them within a week

Keep food detailed log for future ideas for the data use.. Like what what i used to eat, what mostly, recipes etc

[26/06, 10:36 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Spiritual life can be divided into two parts.. First is, when you see that you are from religion, and second is when you see religion is from us
[26/06, 10:39 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): I was like a mainstream temple going religious nutcase until I read osho and few others and until you see that the religions weren't profiting me. Then i start to feel that we are not from religions, religion is from us. I get on my own journey of self exploration until i fell in alignment with loa which i later found become a pretty big new age philosophy of its own.
Things that I done wrong
Decide that you'll not enjoy these until 35 age or until you get rich of this much money - ac, car,..
Not to enjoy something whole life but one time in life
Long term jokes
Life is not feeling meaningful and fun bcoz you are habitual of bigger fun, so, you are desensitized of normal smaller fun. And soon, no fun can satisfy you, no meaning can make your life will meaningful bcoz you are going up and up on the fun/meaning scale. So, sometimes, to make small fun/meaning meaningful, time to time abstain and detox from all fun and meaning.  Do like 7 days detox of no fun.. No mobile, no tasty food, no any kind of pleasure, no mental simulation, like reading books etc or watching movies etc.. Nothing..  Devoid of all fun and meaning so that later even little little fun and meaning can make you happy and excited like a curious child. Remember, we are caveman in clothes and the search for bigger to more bigger fun and meaning have led to dissatisfaction bcoz life is meant to be simple.. And technology and other factors are slow in creating that fun and meaning in life.. They just can't keep up with our growing need for refined and refined fun and meaning.
Make yourself that capable and rich and well off that enemies hate themselves to let them be your enemies
Maybe enrichment is the goal
Am i successful or failure
Enrich your soul daily.. So that one day it is most enriched
I want to be on the cuttingedge of technology and luxury and trends
[02/08, 1:19 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Random thought - don't do efforts bcoz you are motivated, do efforts so that one day when you are actually feeling motivated and happy, you have more reasons to be happy
[02/08, 1:21 AM] ADITYA AGGARWAL (ADI): Do things even if you aren't feeling motivated, bcoz you would be doing these same things, when you are motivated. You in both condition have same time.
Be lazy not now but after..
Visualise exponential success
Do efforts for those things so that when everything played out, you can enjoy them.  
Do efforts for things, so that, when you are happy, you can enjoy that happiness properly
Things i dont know I'll like them that much before.

Things i am yet to unlock - European girls,..
Maybe our ultimate goal in life is to multitask. And the best day, is to do as much big and successful multitasking as possible
Y is it necessary of bad days after good days
Y do you think things will only go bad
Y you see your decisions as bad
Y you can't be happy with your current life. Cheery and all
Before and afters in life
Is negativity our power? Do we deliberately get negative and failures to use them for productivity

sio/dup-Judge achievement deem worthy not them

Create useful memories.. Like you are using that Manali prostitute memories for your confidence etc
What is it to be human
Work for a life where life feels meaningful, days long, long, exciting, thrilling, unexpecting, colourful, rewarding, promising, like a party, effortless, comfortable, where you want to but can't sleep in excitement for the next day,
*aim for a future where everyone around you is happy. Truly happy. Bcoz until you are surrounded by sadness, you can't truly enjoy the happiness in you*
I want that everyone is capable enough to help others
Do something exhilarating to keep you motivated for life
Aspire for a future where life feels like a dream
Like ac and stale air, you only know when you have it
Go one step ahead in planning bcoz..
Take big decisions everyday, in mind
If you can't do marriage, y wait for ddy to help you, fuck girls.. Be a playboy..  Do things like that.. If life don't give you lemons, buy roofza

Even a white wall looks bad with one black dot on it

You can buy the good version later, buy though
I'll be a better duplicate version of ddy
Gamble, rejection

You can do it better later, do it still
Use past
That's why bill gates endorse and adore the book "factfulness" bcoz the author who was a professor find facts around the world that the world is actually relatively becaming a better place, it's just with time, we have media now and cognitive biases that only focus on negativity, and as per survival basis, we focus on negative news that much, bcoz news is what saved us in past from predators and other animals, so, bad news was kinda good for survival bcoz we used to prevent the bad things in past but these days there is no such risk and fake alarms and news only make us feel negative..

I do not want to leave this planet or reality or existence until I enjoyed all that it can and will able to offer. Only then i may think about moving to another reality

Universe couldn't enjoy itself, so, it divided itself to multiple little pieces to enjoy
Intjs life get better but late
If you get managed in mind, you'll get managed outside too. Girls like managed men
We can't change outside world that much, but internal world
something that will make me see even good things as meh.. Something that good.
What if one day, you'll get exponential ways to..
Maybe life is investing in good investments (not just money related) and waiting for profits to roll in

Things unique about me
Maybe learn new things daily
Get to..
Start multiple new
Patience
Competition
There is no limit of learning and growth
Imagine it giving you nice introvert space

Osho.. A mystic.. A poet.. The man who helped making millions of people openminded via his teachings directly and via his thousands of books published all over the world with millions of disciples all over the world and the one who taught there is nothing wrong in being rich and sex is enlightening
Friend the originals
Imagine a life where you can see distinct milestones n turning points
Patience
Imagine a life with you being that able to quickly grab the new desires, like, girls in mdu
Imagine a future where you are able and free to do your tasks freely, being able to solve your problems quickly and freely.. Financial etc
Intention,
Get disappointed daily in night so that you can restart next day in retaliation and anger to make it more worthwhile as new life or another chance
Forget your successes.. There is nothing beyond perfection.. Never let yourself be perfect and if you somehow became, undo it, do some mistakes, if you remember your successes all time, they will prevent you in getting more successes
Mental masturbation
Things that make me addicted to instant gratification - food, porn,..
Life is not only about happiness or getting happy, it's about being happy from right and desired things, from selected things, even if In low amount,
You often can't imagine a future bcoz you can't imagine exact happiness from your desire
Any cheap this or that pleasure can easily make you happy anytime and instantaneously
Life is enjoying the happiness of fulfilling your goal
Live bcoz you'll see more originals and originality in the world rather than stereotypes
Regret of not using all your ideas
Expect less, don't expect too much.
How to handle those failures
How to live without successes or if future is bleak? So that failures or absence of successes don’t break us up
Forget successes
You may feel that you may not get the desired or ideal future in future but if you stop efforting bcoz of this fear,..
To want to go to that future, you need to hate your present
With time, your efforts will get automatic.. So, why worry
With time, life may not get easy, but the struggles and efforts you are currently doing will.
real courage is to trust in future even when your present is in shambles
Live to find interesting techs
I think it's not about not doing gratitude.. But most don't know how to gratitude..
*if your life is not interesting, take interest in others life*
I want it behind.. I want memories of all experiences..
All experiences
My life is getting rich day by day
With time and effort, your life and mind will get refined detailed and sophisticated
With time, your pleasures will get sophisticated.. Same pleasures but sophisticated
Am i visionary?
Manage all things together, which things..
Curiosity, life
Sad, not able to write ideas.. Depressing
I don't want a future without - eyes, family, happy family,
Think of how many times you've used/enjoyed this.. Or wild guess - ex, fridge you have  (365*8=2,920 days.. 2920*10=29200 times)
Imagine, effort so that time to imagine later
As if you are a rich stuck in a hut
Don't break what you have for what you don't have
I want to rebirth as tall, at smart parents, rich family,.. Etc
You've accepted it as normal bcoz you haven't see good things
Give chance to future or give chance to next day.. Live as if you are giving another chance to the universe to make you feel life is interesting and worth living
When you effort, your efforts and ideas will get exponential
No matter how many issues, how many tensions, how many problems... Life is beautiful..
Color your future with this, free your future from this
Sadness bcoz of weak eyes? Bcoz all time difficulty in seeing things

Work so that you'll always have an ideal future to want to work for rather then working to escape a present  
I would be using.. By now
How many layers.. The present would be improved
Refined, like more n more into sex, into intricacies.. And same with other desires
That you get the rest after it and you didn't know about them before it and it helped in getting or enjoying the rest
Usually you think the journey to it will end at it only.. But you are forgetting that it will help in other journeys too
Finding out that it can also enables things like this n this n this.. Etc
What if you find that it also have/enables this or this or this..

See as if you get to do loa contemplation, as if it is not easy and people are getting paid for it, etc..  So, you'll not feel that you are not doing anything. But that it is equal to job efforts
Congratulate yourself for coming to 30 without spending hours working for others (jobs). One Two travel doesn't matter if they are getting bcoz usually their life is doing things for others

All time swag music in background (use Bluetooth earphones)

underachieve then overachieve
You are the life you're living
Richness brings more desires
Necessity is the mother of creativity and epiphanies
Do you want regrets later of not living your life well or wasting time
Don't think that if you have efforted too much, you would have that bcoz there is a limit in success too maybe
How to use past
